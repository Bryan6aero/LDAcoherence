".Easy Street – The mobility journey isn’t as simple as going from point A to B, it’s about what we do with our time along the way. Americans spend more time in their cars than they receive vacation time so the ability to get things done while on the road could change the commute experience as we know it. Ford believes that selfdriving vehicles will reduce society’s pain points and expand access to transportation and goods delivery. The company is working with companies to understand how goods delivery through the use of selfdriving vehicles can be improved. An example of this is a pilot program Ford is conducting with Walmart and Postmates, exploring how selfdriving vehicles can complement Walmart’s home delivery offerings.Many Faces of Me – With social media playing such a large part in consumers’ lives, today many portray various personas – from who they are in real life to how they depict themselves online, which ultimately impacts what they buy, wear and drive, as well as their tec"

"“At the moment. an awful lot of time is spent working on alliances and programmes, and doing all that scholarly research work that needs to be done to set up research trials. A lot of that is going to be swept away and much of the research can and will be automated and done in real time… It will be data driven and the people who can master the technocratic arrangement of both the technology and the commercial underpinnings of that will win. Many people conducting research in a conventional way will look like dinosaurs.”The world is technologically advanced, with fewer people in employment as machines and technology have taken over many roles that were previously carried out by humans. There are a few key private technology corporations dominating all elements of medical research, owning most of the data and choosing where to invest. There is a smaller, private ecosphere driven by philanthropic entrepreneurs who are paying for research to be undertaken in neglected areas. All medicine i"
"“In Germany, a steady growth of OTT services can currently be observed and is likely to continue throughout the year.The audience share of Free TV program might be more affected than ever. Furthermore, the new Federal Data Protection Act Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, which is based on the General Data Protection Regulation, will come into force in May. It will affect marketing as well as OTT services and the IOT. Directly related to this is the coming into force of the ePrivacy Regulation that, among other things, includes regulations relating to electronic communication and will affect especially targeting or modern advertising methods.At this stage, however, it is still unclear whether the regulation will come into force in or at a later stage.

"“Something that will change is that the boundaries between these categories of real estate and infrastructure on some of these assets is becoming increasingly blurred,” says one global sovereign wealth fund investor. “And if you do pool expertise then you have a chance to access some of those investments that otherwise fall through the cracks of real estate and infrastructure. If you look at things like Centre Parcs the UK holiday village company bought by Brookfield from Blackstone in , that was being looked at by private equity firms that were not real estate specialists who were seeing it more as a corporate which happened to own real estate. Things like caravan parks and car parks also fall into that camp, and even things like hospitals, and so in those less traditional real estate sectors there are opportunities.“There are areas where these things overlap and we can combine expertise, for example people who liaise with the public sector can do so for both real estate and infrastru"
"“The response of many companies is disproportionately towards trying to prevent an attack rather than responding quickly to control the damage afterwards,” Tuteja explains. “Clearly, CEOs are taking note of cyber risks and many of them are taking charge to address these personally. However, some may have a false sense of security, as they know they have made significant investments to build capability or have personally gotten closer to cyber security discussions. When you have personally done something about a risk, you inevitably feel more confident about it than if you have just been told that it has been done.”The majority of CEOs are, however, planning to boost their investment in recruitment in the near future. In the past months, percent say they have increased spending on recruitment. Over the next years, the proportion who are increasing investment in recruitment rises to percent. This suggests that businesses are increasingly looking to hire more specialized talent in the yea"
"“There was a research group using machine learning to identify pneumonia patients needing special attention,” he explains. Yet asthmatics, who are in particular danger from pneumonia, were not identified as needing extra attention within this group. “It turned out that doctors addressed these cases right away, as they knew asthmatics were at higher risk, so they were already getting additional help. But because the algorithm didn’t know that, it would have told hospitals to ignore that class of patient. In this case, the researcher told the hospital not to use the algorithm because he did not understand the reasoning behind it. Companies would do well to use similar caution.”But to get there, they must first be very clear on which processes to apply AI to and ensure it will impact their business’ strategy. They must also address consumers’ doubts about privacy, bias, and AIenabled services such as chatbots. Enterprises that undertake their own disruption must fully engage their employe"

"A closely related policy question arises where AI performs a task that, when done by a human, requires evidence of specialized skill or training. In some contexts, society has seemed comfortable thus far dispensing with the formal requirement of certification when technology can be shown to be capable through supervised use. This is true of the autopilot modes of airplanes, which do not have to attend flight school. The question is open with respect to vehicles. But what of technology under development today, such as autonomous surgical robots, the very value of which turns on bringing skills into an environment where no one has them? And how do we think about systems that purport to dispense legal, health, or financial advice, which requires adherence to complex fiduciary and other duties pegged to human judgment? Surgeons and lawyers must complete medical or law school and pass boards or bars. This approach may or may not serve an environment rich in AI, a dynamic that is already unf"
"A coherent workforce strategy must align key decisions with the organisation’s purpose and values. Though TMT organisations are making headway in aligning the management of headlinegrabbing issues such as fair pay, diversity and inclusion, and influencing local policy with their purpose, they aren’t faring nearly as well when it comes to thinking about crises. Just say they ‘always’ consider the organisation’s purpose and values when making decisions in this area. Organisations are also less sure that they make decisions based on purpose and values when it comes to headcount reduction say they ‘always’ align with purpose for this.Getting the technology component of workforce strategy right can be the difference between gaining competitive advantage in the market and falling behind. Decisions about technology need to be made with their impacts on the workforce clearly in mind, or they risk harming the employee experience, productivity and morale. More than of TMT organisations report th"

"a Evaluate the government’s projected industry costs found in federal agency regulatory impact analyses against realworld industry costs that accrue from the new regulations. A majority of respondents. indicated a desire to benchmark the actual costs of new industry regulations against those projected by the regulatory agencies. This research will serve the purpose of assessing the accuracy of the projections published by federal agencies, and will ensure that the actual costs of new regulatory actions are quantified and disseminated throughout the industry. As an example, ATRI conducted research in that found a million difference between FMCSA’s projected benefits and the industry’s costs associated with the more restrictive hour restart provisions. Given the substantial regulatory impact costs identified by ATRI, and FMCSA’s own study that found that the more restrictive provisions did not provide a net safety benefit over the previous restart regulations, these restrictive provision"
"A focus on youth is appropriate because increasing literacy skills over time can be most readily observed among this age group. Adult literacy rates change more slowly because most improvement in literacy occurs mainly through formal education at a young age. The literacy skills of the current elderly cohort may also have improved through participation in adult literacy programmes. However, such programmes rarely reach the entire population of illiterate adults, and previous studies have stressed their limited effect on national literacy figures. Literacy skills can also be lost over time due to a lack of practice, but the effect on aggregate literacy rates of an entire cohort is likely to be small. Another factor to consider is that the composition of today’s elderly population in a country – those aged years and older years ago – has changed over the years because of mortality and migration. Overall, the analysis in this section may slightly underestimate progress over the past years"

"A growing body of theoretical work and empirical evidence demonstrates that there has to be significant real contact with students of other races or ethnicities under positive conditions to realize the full benefits of diverse educational institutions. Educational benefits are inherently tied to access to both tangible and intangible resources. School funding, highquality teachers who aren’t overburdened by struggling students, challenging and stimulating curriculum, appropriate technology, and strong school communities all support learning. Unfortunately, these resources are not distributed evenly. More often than not, such resources are concentrated in schools serving white and often Asian students from families with relative wealth. Conversely, many black and Hispanic students from families with fewer economic resources are relegated to schools that lack many of these essential resources. One of the key benefits of school desegregation is that all students are able to access the res"
"A key unique capability of this tool is feature engineering. It performs automated feature creation using preexisting features. Various transformations and aggregated functions are used to develop new features. The user can select how exhaustive feature engineering should be. As an example, if the input data contains transactional data in each row and there is a timestamp column present, the tool will automatically generate features like number of transactions in last days, or in the last month. This saves the user time to look through the raw data and calculate new aggregate columns. The tool generates thousands of columns and uses feature selection to include only the best and limited features for modeling. The user has an option to use Xapanse.ai for the modeling process, or export the newly developed feature set and use it in some other modeling environment of their choice.Compellon The tool has no onpremises installation option. It is only available through a cloud service. The ma"
"A lot has changed in the world over the last decade social media, U.S. presidents, electric cars, health care options, big data, K TVs, the economy, just to name a few. Similarly, a lot has changed in the preemployment assessment world within the last – years. Advances in technology have been at the core of many of these changes as practices evolve and have created opportunities for organizations to better select quality hires. However, one thing that has not changed is the war for talent companies competing for the best candidates to fill their available job positions. Given these changes, a key question remains What are these new trends, or big ideas, in the preemployment arena, and are these trends appropriate for all companies? This paper will intro­duce five prominent preemployment assessment trends and focus on the pros and cons of these trends that are impacting the way companies select candidates in today’s world. Although some of these trends have been around longer than this "
"A major part of the exercise was checking and validating the raw data obtained from these different sources. The first step was to convert all of the figures to common measurement units for capacity, production and numbers of beneficiaries. The data were then adjusted to account for the lifetime of some devices e.g., assuming that solar lights will be used for only about three years and that biogas digesters will be gradually retired as they get older. Additional checks were made to avoid overestimation by, for example, checking that the number of household connections was used as the measure of the population served by minigrids rather than the total population in the locality and, for older plants, checking that plants are still functioning and could be included in the analysis. As a final step, the dataset was reviewed as part of the REN Global Status Report peer review process in the first quarter of.Within commercial and public uses, most solar PV use is for powering telecommunica"

The CoSN Annual Erate and Infrastructure Survey found that affordability still remains the primary obstacle for robust connectivity even though progress has been made network speed and capacity pose significant challenges for schools and, finally, too many school systems report a lack of competition for broadband services in many parts of the United States, particularly in rural areas.

"A second concern is whether the assumptions required to “identify” a causal e.ect are satis.ed, where in econometrics we say that a parameter is identi.ed if we can learn it eventually with in.nite data where even in the limit, the data has the same structure as in the sample considered. It is well known that the causal e.ect of a treatment is not identi.ed without making assumptions, assumptions which are generally not testable that is, they cannot be rejected by looking at the data. Examples of identifying assumptions include the assumption that the treatment is randomly assigned, or that treatment assignment is “unconfounded.” In some settings, these assumptions require the analyst to observe all potential “confounders” and control for them adequately in other settings, the assumptions require that an instrumental variable is uncorrelated with the unobserved component of outcomes. In many cases it can be proven that even with a data set of in.nite size, the assumptions are not testa"
"A senior trader at a large US asset manager explains they take a multilayered approach to evaluating liquidity, assessing both the onscreen liquidity of the ETF itself as well as that of the underlying constituents. “To measure secondary liquidity, we look at bidask spreads and ADV traded across multiple periods, as well as trading behaviour during stressed market environments. We also assess the current size of the fund in relation to potential inflows from our team. For underlying liquidity, we measure the creation basket to understand how much of the underlying securities would be impacted given different creation sizes,” he says.Angelo Meda, head of equities at Banor SIM, an independent investment management firm based in Italy, says “We use these ETFs mainly for strategic allocations, although we sometimes use them for hedging or for tactical exposure.

"A study of over , sea turtle bycatch records from sources found that the highest bycatch rates occurred in the East Pacific, Northwest and Southwest Atlantic, and Mediterranean regions. However, these were also the regions that contributed the highest volume of data. Over of this data comprised records from longline fisheries. While the bycatch occurring in these fisheries is of serious conservation concern, the authors point out that “data poor” coastal areas off Africa, within the Northern Indian Ocean and throughout Southeast Asia are also known to host numerous nesting colonies of turtles from RMUs that are under high threat from smallscale fisheries,. As such, the magnitude of the threat posed by smallscale gillnet fisheries in these areas where so little research on bycatch has occurred may not be accurately reflected in the map to the right.WWF has been committed to sea turtle conservation for over years and is actively involved in monitoring and reducing fisheries bycatch all o"
"A The process of ‘learning’ involves training a neural network using very large sets of training data which are labelled with correct responses. To improve its ability to get correct answers the neural network is repeatedly exposed to the training data. The neural network ‘learns’ to produce correct answers by trying, succeeding, or failing and adjusting how and when neural network nodes signal connected nodes. Once a network completes the training phase it can then be optimized and deployed – this latter phase is called inferencing.A The HP Z G workstation is designed to host the large amounts of fast storage and computational power needed for Deep Learning training. It is also designed for operation to facilitate training sessions that can take days to complete and facilitate the many sessions that may be required to complete a training workflow.

"A When you sit back and consider both why you entered the field of education and where students will be headed when they leave your classroom and school, this seems to be an easy answer. This is one of the most critical elements of helping your students be able to spread their wings once they leave the K environment. Many of Indiana’s universities are highly diverse both with international student populations that will be teaching some of their classes but also there are many more cultural backgrounds represented than to what some of our Hoosier students may be accustomed. Should your students be moving along to the workforce or the armed forces, interactions with individuals from backgrounds and with languages different than theirs are almost inevitable, thus it is our job as educators to prepare them for their next steps. If you are an elementary or middle level educator, you have the unique ability to establish such a strong and intriguing foundation for students to continue pursuin"

"Abstract. Precipitation events are expected to become sub­stantially more intense under global warming, but few global comparisons of observations and climate model simulations are available to constrain predictions of future changes in precipitation extremes. We present a systematic globalscale comparison of changes in historical – annualmaximum daily precipitation between station observations compiled in HadEX and the suite of global climate mod­els contributing to the ffth phase of the Coupled Model In­tercomparison Project CMIP. We use both parametric and nonparametric methods to quantify the strength of trends in extreme precipitation in observations and models, taking care to sample them spatially and temporally in comparable ways.

"Academic Editor name Received date Accepted date Published date Abstract Dengue is a major public health concern and an economic burden in the Philippines. Despite the country’s improved dengue surveillance, it still suffers from various setbacks and therefore needs to be complemented with alternative approaches. Previous studies have demonstrated the potential of internetbased surveillance such as Google Dengue Trends GDT in supplementing current epidemiological methods for predicting future dengue outbreaks and patterns. With this, our study aims to assess the temporal relationship of GDT and dengue incidence in Metropolitan Manila from previous years and examine web search behavior of the population towards the disease. The study collated and organized the population statistics and reported dengue cases in Metropolitan Manila from respective government agencies to calculate the spatial and temporal dengue incidence.

"Accounting between them for an increase in NIA of US billion, Brazil and Mexico are the driving forces behind growth in Latin America. Brazil faces the challenge of weakening factors it relied on for growth in the past, such as rising employment or flourishing commodity trading. To counteract this trend, future growth should increasingly be generated through higher investment and productivity. This would create interesting opportunities for wealthy private investors. Mexico pursues a sustainable economic growth strategy with political reform, including deregulation of energy and telecommunications markets, coupled with international trade agreements. Similar to North America, Latin America has the advantage of a relatively integrated market and a largely uniform language base.

That means understanding people at a holistic level and recognizing that their outlooks and needs change at a moment’s notice.Technology is letting businesses maintain ongoing, experiencedriven relationships with individual consumers in ways that were impossible before. But with these technologyenabled possibilities comes new ambiguity and complexity, along with key challenges that companies must address. Among them recog"

Finally, Chinese investments in massive infrastructure programs – such as the “Silk Road Economic Belt” and “st Century Maritime Silk Road” which together link countries across Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa – portend dramatic increases in trade, but not necessarily greater stability as an end result. More trade via ocean and advanced overland routes in this region will put a higher percentage of national GDP for most nations in the region and beyond at risk and will require greater defense expenditures to maintain the security of these routes over time, whether the threats to these routes are national or transnational in nature.From to , global arms transfers reached their highest volume for any year period since the end of the Cold War.

"AI and ML have rapidly progressed over the past few years. According to Forbes, marked a period of meteoric rise of this technology. ML in particular is playing a prominent role in digital transformation for several reasons, such as the falling cost of data storage. Commodity hardware, the spread of opensource technology such as Hadoop, and the growth of the cloud are making it very cheap to store data, resulting in the rise of big data. Much of this data provides excellent training material for learners and is being packaged for easy use in resources such as ImageNet and data.gov.There are two essential kinds of problems AI can solve. The first involves scenarios where theoretical modeling can be applied to approximate and predict behavior. The second focuses on problems where diligent parametric observation provides enough data to fit a mathematical formula. The first type of problem, known as knowledge engineering, involves coders and experts who team up to explicitly program human "
"AI can play chess and Go, but these are goalori­ented applications of pattern management and decision engines. IBM’s premier AI system, Watson, can play Jeopardy, but it is not actually a single AI system. It is several that have been connected together to accomplish a task playing the game. It is a natural language processor, two data retrieval systems, a decision engine, a set of trained models and filters, and a final natural lan­guage processor. It reads the clue, deconstructs it, explores unstructured data for possible answers, scores the validity of these answers, synthesizes these results using human and taught filters and then constructs an answer. But these systems were built to serve a purpose, and it took time and human effort to figure out how to best tackle the problem of providing a good answer within the rules of a game. If Watson had been designed to do something else, it would have different compo­nents. It took time and effort to generalize it — to convert it from a J"
"AI will have a fundamental impact on the global labor market in the coming years. A machine powered by Artificial Intelligence can work reliably, – and it cannot be distracted by fatigue or other external circumstances. Another positive factor is that the level of accuracy is much higher than that of humans. In the decisionmaking process such systems can be guided by objective standards, so decisions can be made unemotionally, based on facts rather than feelings and opinions. To rely on the decisions, or to believe that decisions made by machines powered by Artificial Intelligence are correct, we need to test these systems. Such systems are already in use. Google, for example uses them to improve their products. The company is rethinking and has applied AI across all products to solve problems. For example, its Streetview automatically recognizes restaurants with the help of machine learning. Google is continuously testing and improving its machine learning using AI itself.When robotic"

"All data on maternal mortality include a degree of uncertainty associated with the error in a particular data source. Some data are always systematically lower or higher than the true value of the variable being measured. For example, the numbers of deaths reported in CRVS records will be systematically lower than the true number, because there will always be deaths that go unreported. This is referred to as systematic error. Estimates of the amount of systematic error for a given data source were calculated based on past analyses that assessed the extent to which data from that source differed from the truth as determined by rigorous specialized studies which looked to determine underreporting of maternal mortality, see Annex. Based on these assessments, adjustments were then applied to the data to account for systematic error and bring it closer to the “truth” using methods similar to the previous estimation round. These adjustments contribute uncertainty to the final estimates of ma"
"All employers are in a war for talent that is no longer a local battle, and if they haven’t experienced it directly, they soon will. Global HR leaders must stretch their comfort zones, change their past behaviors and expand their thinking to attract, retain and engage top talent. As a lot of skilled jobs leave the U.S., the global skilledlabor workforce is shifting. For example, the World Economic Forum reports that Russia and Iran have displaced Japan among the top producers of engineering graduates, while the U.S. has a tentative hold on second place.An example that typifies this trend is an organization based in the United States that expanded its search for a compensation and benefits professional, because domestic applicants did not fit the job requirements. Candidates applied from each continent around the world, and in the end, the employer secured the position in Toronto, Canada.

"Although AI applications have the potential to reduce human bias and error, they can also reflect and reinforce biases in the data used to train them. Concerns have been raised about the potential of AI to lead to discrimination in ways that may be hidden or which may not align with legally protected characteristics, such as gender, ethnicity, disability, and age. The House of Lords Select Committee on AI has cautioned that datasets used to train AI systems are often poorly representative of the wider population and, as a result, could make unfair decisions that reflect wider prejudices in society. The Committee also found that biases can be embedded in the algorithms themselves, reflecting the beliefs and prejudices of AI developers. Several commentators have called for increased diversity among developers to help address this issue.The new EU General Data Protection Regulation GDPR states that data subjects have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated proc"
"Although progress is being made on the micro­prudential front, the empirical analysis suggests that macroprudential perspectives are needed to address risks related to the sectors’ increased common exposures. The analysis underscores the notion that systemic risks not only arise from the potential domino effects created by the insolvency of an individual institution, but also stem, increasingly, from the sector’s growing common exposures. This means that supervisors should monitor not only individual firms but also the behavior of the sector as a whole and the interconnections with the rest of the financial system. Enhanced systemwide reporting and disclosure requirements for new andor less liquid investment products and for duration gaps based on internationally agreed definitions would help supervisors identify greater risktaking by insurers. Moreover, the IAIS c work on macroprudential policy mea­sures to strengthen the resilience of the insurance sector should be advanced quickly. "

"Although the linear model of many supply chains has remained largely unchanged until comparatively recently, supply chains have been evolving due to continuous technology disruptions and changing business needs.

In the s, consumer packaged goods manufacturers and retailers came up with regional distribution centres to expand their businesses and operate more efficiently. This journey progressed and underwent a series of changes. And in the few years, automation has dominated supply chain development to the extent that priority is now given to the seamless functioning of mobile robots and automated materialhandling systems.

The murky path of Brexit is likely a contributing factor to this decline.

"Another issue that can be resolved by the use of property language is the question of consent from donors to allow the ABMDR to transfer the biospecimens to third parties. As noted above, ABMDR policy currently does not allow biospecimens provided by it to others to be kept other than for the duration of an individual research project. In other words, participants are not ordinarily asked to consent for their samples to be used beyond a single research project. On one view, if the ABMDR is the owner of such samples, it is not necessary to seek further consent once the tissue has been gifted to the ABMDR. However, it may be more ethically acceptable to amend consent forms for those joining the ABMDR as a donor or a patient to encompass the possibility of sharing with second parties and beyond.

"Artificial intelligence is based on the perception of information that can originate from sensors, images, language and text. From this information, the software draws its conclusions, learns, adjusts parameters accordingly and generates hypotheses. In the end, it reaches a decision on its own or makes a recommendation that human partners can use to underpin their own actions.Two of the reasons this works so well are that computing speed continues to evolve exponentially and that graphics processing units are increasingly being used. These units GPUs for short are computer chips whose strength lies in the simultaneity of mathematical operations and are therefore highly suited to deep learning tasks.Developments in the field of artificial intelligence are expected to progress significantly in the future. There are two main reasons for this on the one hand, technological progress and, on the other, the fact that the best algorithms are now available to everyone and everyone can improve t"
"Artificial intelligence promises both to improve existing goods and services, and, by enabling the automation of many tasks, to greatly increase the efficiency with which they are produced.

This exploratory essay considers this possibility in three interrelated ways. First, we review the history of artificial intelligence, focusing in particular on the distinction between automationoriented applications such as robotics and the potential for recent developments in “deep learning” to serve as a generalpurpose method of invention. We then assess preliminary evidence of this differential impact in changing nature of measurable innovation outputs in artificial intelligence, including papers and patents.

"As highlighted in last year’s report, the majority of Myanmarese people are highly devout Theravada Buddhists, regularly giving money and time to ordained monks and nuns, and for the upkeep of temples. Such charitable giving is integral to religious observance among Theravada Buddhists and whilst, in many cases, the amounts given will be very small, they still have significant religious meaning and so individuals give regularly, sometimes even on a daily basis. By topping the World Giving Index ranking Myanmar will likely, and rightly, receive a lot of attention, not least because as a country classified by the World Bank as Lower Middle Income, it confounds assumptions about the association between wealth and generosity. Inevitably, such an achievement will be contrasted with recent reports about the suffering, and contested rights of the Rohingya people.

First, the total number of faults throughout the world, as reported in the three databases, is presented from an absolute percentage point of view. Second, the data is normalized using the total number of systems and their associated lengths. Lengthnormalized fault rates are presented in units of ‘faults per kilometers per year’, calculated as the sum of number of faults divided by the total length of cable known to the respective organizations. The data is further separated into two depth ranges – cable in less than meter water depth shallow water and cable in greater than ­meter water depth deep water.While the industry has continued to place great focus on cable routing, burial, armoring, cable awareness, and Automatic Identification System AIS programs to improve protection and reduce fault rates, there continues to be about to faults per year globally.

"As is well understood, shifts in sentiment play an important role in housing markets. When prices are rising, people are attracted to the market in the hope of capital gains. At some point, though, valuations become so stretched that demand tails off and there is a shift in momentum. When prices are falling, its the reverse. The prospect of capital losses leads buyers to stay away or to delay purchasing. At some point, though, the lower prices draw more buyers into the market. First home owners find it easier to buy a home, investors are attracted back into the market, and tradeup buyers take the opportunity to upgrade to the home they have always wanted. These shifts in sentiment and momentum are seen in most housing cycles, but their precise timing is difficult to predict.The more important influence, though, is what is happening with household income. For many people, the main source of their wealth is their human capital that is, their future earning capacity. As I have discussed o"
"As many observers e.g., Weiler have noted, transnational constitutionalism has been a key concept in the quest for a unified Europe. In its caselaw starting with the landmark Van Gend and Loos ruling , the European Court of Justice ECJ, the highest court of the EU introduced the principle of the direct effect of Community law on the Member States, which now enables European citizens to rely directly on rules of European Union law in their national courts. In its ruling in the Costa case, the ECJ went on to establish the primacy of Community law over domestic law. In , Francovich, Bonifaci and others v Italy, the ECJ es­tablished the liability of a Member State to individuals for damage caused to them by a breach of Community law by that State.

As part of this effort, EPRI developed an envelope of four possible future scenarios, representing plausible boundaries for what the future might look like. In contemplating each scenario, EPRI identified how such a future would impact the electricity industry and society and what the key RD needs would be. Throughout this process, EPRI identified “Global Points of View” that are consistent across many, if not all, of the scenarios, helping to shape a vision of a research strategy moving forward and identifying any gaps that may need to be addressed. These paint a vision of the future, and EPRI’s Integrated Energy Network is the pa"
"As the number and type of philanthropic organizations continue to grow across the world and they become more influential actors in the education and development sector, there is a demand to deepen collective knowledge of the sector. Arguably, education and health are the two sectors that attract the largest amount of financial support by individuals, corporations and foundations. Furthermore, international organizations tend to highlight the importance of cooperating with new partners to reach the Sustainable Development Goals. While some studies have highlighted the complementary role that philanthropic institutions play in the distribution of public goods, such as education, other studies have raised concerns related to equity, accountability, neutrality, effectiveness and efficiency.The symposium series Philanthropy in Education Global Trends, Regional Differences and Diverse Perspectives is a new initiative launched and cosponsored by NORRAG, the Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi Foun"

"As this report shows, global employee engagement has fallen. To better understand what is behind the global trend we need to examine engagement levels and yearoveryear changes by region and market. As we see in the graph below, there is a great deal of variability in both engagement level and engagement trend across the globe. Some of the engagement level variability is due to cultural differences where it may be frowned upon to be overly enthusiastic or negative. Other factors like political or economic stability can influence engagement. The graph illustrates with the clustering of the largest bubbles indicating relative market GDP and labor pool size to the left of the vertical line, that the decrease in global engagement is a function of the engagement decrease in engagement in the United States and many of the world’s other largest markets in Asia and Europe.The placement of Rewards Recognition at the top of the drivers deserves attention up from the number three ranking last year"
"As you know, antibiotics are often approved on a small number of indications or studied mostly on simple, often soft tissue infections with noninferiority trials and then used in a wider range of infections or when needed because of sensitivity testing. So that was probably more straightforward and researchers know that on gramnegative, that the sources or more easy sources of difficulttocombat resistance, it has always been more difficult to find new antibiotics. So the working group was quite happy of the final result, indicating gramnegative as the top priority. This should foster and support much more basic research science too so this is an invitation also to public agencies to fund more research work and bench work on gramnegative in general because the discovery of an antibiotic is truly a complex task and not at all something simple and straightforward. So we have to go back to basic research and then think about quicker development.MK I can take this one. So what is important "

"Assistant Professor Christian Mac rum of the Natural History Museum of Denmark at the University of Copenhagen leads the groundbreaking study One of the problems with the hypothesis of global warming is that it is difficult to predict what happens to ecosystems and biodiversity as the planet warms. By examining animals of the past and species adaptability, we can more accurately respond to the question of what leads to crises in ecosystems, and what happens thereafter. Thus far, it has been a big problem that some of the largest fluctuations in biodiversity through geological time have been exceptionally tough to grasp and accurately date. As such, it has been difficult to compare possible environmental impacts and their effects on biodiversity. Among other things, this is because climate change takes place quite abruptly, in a geological perspective. As previous calculations of biodiversity change in deep time have been based on a timebinning partitioning divided into — million year i"

"At the national level, a bundle of strategies and tools is available to public authorities to support the shift towards inclusive, resourceefficient and pollutionfree economies. The overarching strategies manifest differently in terms of possible pathways depending on a country’s level of natural resource endowment and its socioeconomic context. Absolute decoupling is recommended as an aim for highincome nations, with the need to lower average resourceconsumption levels, distribute prosperity equally including for gender equality and maintain a high quality of life. Strategies toward waste prevention, highvalue resource recovery, circular resource flows and adjusting social norms are particularly relevant. Relative decoupling is a key strategy wellsuited to developing economies and economies in transition to raise average income levels and eliminate poverty.

When we asked journalists if the public had lost or gained trust in the media over the last year, percent said people had lost trust, with only percent saying the opposite. While that’s still a trou­bling number, it is down from percent in last year’s survey. Why the decline?

"Beyond looking at the clear spatial dimensions of land, it is also important to understand the history attached to land. When determining how far back to go in time in considering the landrelated claims in question and the nature of previous abuse or violation of related human rights, it is critical to have a clear understanding and definition of the specific property violation. In the case of legacy land issues, the grievance is related to the terms and processes by which land was previously acquired and subsequently used by a company and which have been left unaddressed, in part or in full, by the predecessor or existing producer. In applying this definition, it is the responsibility of the current landholding company to evaluate, at a minimum, any claims and related preexisting unresolved community grievances linked to the terms and processes by which the land in question was acquired and used by the company itself and a preceding landholding interest or stateowned enterprise.

"Bonded Warehouses These warehouses are licenced by the Government to accept imported goods for storage until the payment of customs duty. They are located near the ports. They are either operated by the Government or work under the control of customs authorities. The warehouse is required to give an undertaking or Bond that it will not allow the goods to be removed without the consent of the custom authorities. The goods are held in bond and cannot be withdrawn without paying the customs duty. Such warehouses are very helpful to importers and exporters. If an importer is unable to pay customs duty immediately after the arrival of goods he can store the goods in a bonded warehouse. He can withdraw the goods in instalments by paying the customs duty proportionately.

"Box Population ageing and international migrationWhile declining fertility and increasing longevity are the key drivers of population ageing globally, international migration has also contributed to changing the population age structure in some countries and regions. In countries that are experiencing large immigration flows, international migration can slow the ageing process, at least temporarily, since migrants tend to be concentrated in the working ages.

The number of countries with policies to increase rates of immigration rose from in to in and of those countries per cent also identified population ageing as a “major concern” in United Nations,.

They measure global trends using decadal moving averages, which are then averaged across countries. As we do, they .nd that global safe interest rates have been declining since the mids, while risky returns have been roughly stable over this period, consistent with the safety trap hypothesis. However, they identify even more pronounced declines in the safe rate in the period comprising the two world wars. This result contrasts with our .nding that the trend in the world real interest rate was relatively stable over this period. The source of this discrepancy is that, unlike moving averages, our trendcycle decomposition attributes much of the decline in rates in the interwar period to cyclical .uctuations.

"Building refurbishment is imperative in markets such as Washington, DC and Manhattan where the supply of Class A space is growing rapidly. Landlords who do not update their assets will eventually face pressure to lower rent, but, in some markets, it will take a lot more differentiation for an asset to stand out – so many developers will be embarking on major capital improvements.

"But sustained growth of the world’s older population also presents challenges. Population aging now affects economic growth, formal and informal social support systems, and the ability of states and communities to provide resources for older citizens. Nations must quickly recognize the scope of the new demographic reality and adjust current policies accordingly. Experience has shown that such adjustments may be painful—changes in retirement ages and medical benefits, for example, are not widely popular. But experience also shows that it is easier to address problems sooner rather than later, when the cost of waiting may become insurmountable. We can think about preparing for older age on both an individual and societal level. On an individual level, people need to focus on preventive health and financial preparedness. We know that many individuals approach older age with little or no savings. A simple example illustrates the financial cost of waiting to save and the value of a more far"
"But this approach is only secure against a semihonest adversary. A malicious party can use a wrong value in place of x x which goes undetected since the addition is done locally. We can prevent this by performing the addition inside another malicious PC but this would double both round and communication cost. We introduce new techniques to avoid this extra cost in case of binary sharing PC. Consider the traditional ripplecarry full adder where the full adder operation FAxi,xi,ci. ci,si normally takes two input bits xi,xi and a carry bit ci and produces an output bit si and the next carry bit ci. We modify the full adder to instead take xi as its third input. It is then easy to see that x x x c s. As a result, k parallel invocations of FA in a single round to compute c and s and one evaluation of a parallel pre.x adder circuit to compute c s are su.cient to compute x. This results in log k rounds and k log k k bits of communication which is almost a factor of better than log k rounds an"
"But while high marijuana prices may be the bigger problem for regulators in the shortterm, very low prices could prove to be the more important issue in the longterm. As the legal marijuana market develops and growers begin to refine their techniques, the price of marijuana could drop significantly and spur an increase in consumption see “Legalization’s Effect on Marijuana Consumption,” on page. Considering that one of the potential goals of levying an excise tax is to discourage the consumption of a product, states could consider setting up their marijuana excise tax so that it creates a price floor. For example, if the pretax price of retail marijuana falls to per ounce but state lawmakers want to ensure that marijuana is never cheaper than an ounce, the state could require that the total tax collected at the cash register be the greater of the statutory tax rate, or the tax rate needed to raise the final price to in this case.Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, How Sales and "

"Capabilities would thus be realised in different ways not only between nations and regions, but also between industries and fields of practice. They provide the conceptual basis of qualifications, but the specific focus and content of teaching and learning and curriculum requires deep understandings of the contexts for which students are being prepared, engagement with local communities of interest, and negotiation over the outcomes. For example, the capabilities that electricians need will differ from those of childcare workers. Both will require an understanding of the theoretical basis of their practice for example, mathematics for electricians, theories of child development for childcare workers, both will need to develop the technical skills that underpin practice in their field, and both will need to develop the attributes required of practitioners in their field. They both need to understand their communities, and be able to participate in their workplaces in shaping practice. T"

"Changes in the energy sector may have an impact on various dimen­sions of international politics, such as security, trade, or environmental poli­cies. However, it is difficult to project their range and impact beforehand. In this sense, this study is exploratory and describes trends in technological developments in the energy sector by examining three technological devel­opments at different stages of readi­ness and deployment. The first is a set of technologies that can be sum­marized under the title “hydraulic fracturing”, which has influenced the position of the US in global energy markets and will do so in the coming years. The second technology trend is the use of solar energy from photo­voltaic cells, also commonly referred to as “solar panels”. With rapidly de­creasing costs and a massive extension of industrial production, solar energy is in the process of revolutionizing energy systems around the globe. The third part concentrates on the effects of the upcoming widescale distr"
"Chile is a highly centralized state. This trait can also be found in the manner in which the general egovernment agenda has unfolded. Starting in , the Chilean government enacted the Law ., and since then a group of regulations has been put in place to implement the ability of citizens to access public information. Public agencies have to abide by these regulations, making access to public data easier for all citizens. Similar to Brazil’s and Colombia’s, in the Chilean approach to egovernment initiatives are linked to two main concepts open access to public information and ICT to increase public participation in government activities. In the first domain, the milestone is the enactment of the Freedom of Access to Pub­lic Information Law. in. This law opened public agencies to public scrutiny, allowing citizens to access information regarding topics such as salaries and contractors. It also defined fines for public managers who were unwilling to provide information considered as public."
"China equally cannot set the conditions for competition and innovation here in the United States. The United States should not ignore Chinese policies that are adverse to U.S. economic interests, but our top priority should always be to reinforce the United States’ own sources of competitive advantage. China doesn’t determine how much we invest in our own infrastructure, how much support we provide for research and development, how much we invest in our own workforce, how we use the tax system to incentivize and reward lowwage work, or how we tax the international activities of U.S. multinational companies. While it is no doubt controversial, I attach particular importance to ending the provisions of the new tax code that appear to continue to reward the offshoring of intellectual property and certain factories and jobs. Rather than courting Chinese state investment, the United States should be encouraging American firms to invest more here at home. Provisions that artificially lower t"

"China seeks this presence based on its changing military focus and expanding international economic interests, which are increasing demands for the PLA to operate in more distant maritime environments to protect Chinese citizens, investments, and critical sea lines of communication SLOCs. These demands require logistics and intelligence support, including in the Indian Ocean and more distant areas. China is expanding its access to foreign ports to preposition the necessary logistics support to regularize and sustain deployments in the “far seas.” A robust overseas logistics and basing infrastructure will allow China to project and sustain military power at greater distances. China’s leaders may judge that a mixture of military logistics models, including preferred access to overseas commercial ports and a limited number of exclusive PLA logistic facilities – probably collocated with commercial ports – most closely aligns with China’s overseas military logistics needs.

"Choosing a Rating System Trying to appeal to all clients looking for green construction is simply too much for even the biggest and most experienced companies. Firms that are still expanding into green construction should start with a popular rating system or design modality and build their familiarity with it before moving on to a new one. Globally, LEED is one of the most popular green building evaluation systems, with over , commercial buildings participating in the program as of and is a good starting point for most firms. Training to meet the specific requirements of a popular rating system helps fill in any gaps in existing approaches.Investing in Training Green construction often requires hundreds or even thousands of small adjustments to the building process to reach the goals of the finished structure. As a result, construction workers may need comprehensive training to become familiar with current techniques. Simply specifying the use of the new methods and not training the w"

"Clearly there is no single magic bullet. As suggested by the IPCC, we need a number of major international research programmes. The research challenge applies to six major areas. First there are the three main types of clean energy supply renewables especially solarand wind, nuclear power, and coal and gas subject to carbon capture and storage CCS. All have important roles to play, depending on the country in question. In sunny areas like India, Africa and SE Asia solar can play a central role, In more Northern areas, like Japan and Northern Europe, nuclear has an important role, as does CCS in areas rich in coal and natural gas.Hydrogen. Hydrogen can act as a storage medium for electricity. An electric current however produced can be used to electrolyse water to produce hydrogen and oxygen. Then, when the electricity is actually needed, the operation can be reversed in a “fuel cell”. In this cell hydrogen is passed through a membrane to combine with oxygen, producing water – but the s"
"Clearly, not as much work has been on the causes of math anxiety as on the concept itself. Geist reported the “most consistent risk factor for low achievement in mathematics is family income level”. To explain how a connection between income and math achievement occurs, the author suggested that children from low socioeconomic backgrounds can have parents who are math averse or math anxious and pass the trait onto their children. Such an inheritance can cause problems even before a child enters school, since many concepts are best learned before the age of five. “The seemingly simple understanding that numbers have a quantity attached to them,” wrote the author, is actually a complex relationship that children must construct”.If there is one group the blame for math anxiety most often focuses on, it is math teachers.

"Commuter rail and highspeed services are among the most dynamic subsegments in terms of performance growth. Commuter rail is more widespread and focuses on passenger transport in metropolitan areas. Its implementation is relatively simple, especially if previous railway infrastructure exists. Highspeed rail, however, is still restricted to a few countries, most of them with high development levels. The main reason for this are the high implementation costs linked to this technology. Highspeed services still do not exist in many regions, such as South and Central America, Africa and AustraliaPacific, and they have been implemented only to a limited extend in North America and the CIS. China is an important exception in this respect, since it has managed to develop the world’s largest highspeed rail network in a very short period of time.The rail freight segment has grown less positively in the past five years and it registered an absolute reduction in for the first time after.

"Comparing government satisfaction ratings with realworld indicators such as GDP, inflation, unemployment and so on, clear patterns are hard to find. First, look at the indicators that seem to make little difference to government ratings absolute levels of GDP in a version of the Easterlin paradox, while richer individuals are around twice as satisfied with their government as those on lower incomes, this doesn’t apply to richer countries, inflation, or inequality. Although at first glance there does seem to a relationship between satisfaction with government and the rate of GDP change i.e. that faster growing countries are happier than those with more stagnant economies, this is mostly due to the outlier that is India – remove it, and the link is much weaker. Simply throwing money at the problem doesn’t seem to work either. If anything, there is a negative relationship between the level of government expenditure as a percentage of GDP and government satisfaction ratings.In the workplac"
"Competitive pressures driven by the surge in auctions have altered the financial arrangements in wind energy investments. Opting for a corporate finance structure where you internalise the project’s management allows power producers to raise cheaper debt at corporate level during construction phase, and therefore lower the cost of finance. However, a number of large offshore projects that reached FID in were financed by significant lending on a project finance basis. Developers have been able to take advantage of the competitive lending mar­ket and finance their projects with cheap debt. This has allowed smaller developers to finance large offshore pro­jects, an area which has typically been dominated by a few of the largest developers with the resources to fund large projects on their balance sheets i.e. with corporate finance.Corporate renewable PPAs to date are still limited to a handful of countries although saw the first cor­porate PPAs signed in four countries Poland, Germany, De"
"Complex and varied social, structural and economic dynamics within countries account for the uneven geographical distribution of HIV. In many countries, HIV prevalence is higher in cities, where the vibrancy, stress and anonymity of urban life, and its bustle of encounters and interactions, provide increased opportunities for behaviours and sexual networking that may increase the risk of HIV infection.

"Computational efficiency is increasingly giving rise to computational empathy.

"Computers that learn to recognize a whiskered, furry face often need millions of examples to categorize objects that we can classify with just a few. After extensive training, the comput­er might be able to identify an image of a cat that it has never seen before. But it does so in ways that are quite different from human generalizations. Because the computer software reasons differently, slipups occur. Some cat images will not be labeled as crete data because we already know a lot and especially because the brain is already capable of understanding basic abstract concepts. Like scientists, we can use those concepts to formu­late hypotheses about the world and make predictions about what data events should look like if those hypotheses are right—the reverse of trying to extract patterns from the raw data themselves, as in bottomup AI.An article in Nature in demonstrated just how far bot­tomup methods have come.

"Consumer privacy will also gain attention in. As companies adjust to privacy changes in response to the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR, consumers and policymakers will be more aware of the varying levels of data privacy protections and policies. At some point in the near future, consumers in the U.S. are going to ask, “Why can’t we do this here?” This question will challenge many business models, especially what Shoshana Zuboff, author and retired Charles Edward Wilson professor of business administration at the Harvard Business School, calls “surveillance capitalism.” Healthcare will be pulled into the discussion and analysis as policymakers begin to explore what policy changes need to occur to increase consumer protection and confidence in healthcare data transmission security.

"Continuing the trend from last year, large institutional investors and pension funds are pushing for more aligned approaches to corporate governance across borders to support longterm value creation. Regulators are responding, particularly in emerging economies and those with nascent corporate governance regimes.

Where regulators have not yet caught up to or agreed with investor expectations, institutional investors are engaging companies directly to advocate for the governance reforms they want to see. These investors also expect more from their boards than ever before and are increasingly willing to intervene when they do not feel they are being responsibly represented in the boardroom.Populist political movements have gained broad support in several countries around the world, contributing to uncertainty about the future regulatory and political environments of two of the world’s five largest e"

"Credit events and a reassessment of debt sustainability in the context of increasing leverage. Boosted by the low interest rate environment, private sector leverage is high and rising in many economies. This is increasing credit risk, while maturity mismatch and liquidity risks are also higher. Capital flows in emerging economies are progressively reliant on volatile retail investors, and debt is increasing rapidly in lowincome countries, which display more complicated debt structures and depend on official bilateral creditors that are not part of creditor coordination mechanisms—such as the Paris Club. In China, private sector debt is accumulating rapidly—the authorities have taken steps to strengthen the financial sector, but risks remain elevated in the banking and nonbanking sectors.

"Culberson reasons that applying an algorithm to all possible functions or any closedunder­permutation set of functions gives the adversary too much power, in that it allows an adversary to return values that are completely independent of the algorithm in use. This is an early recognition of the importance of dependence for successful search. He evaluates issues in evolutionary algo­rithms, such as the implications of NFL for Holland’s oncecelebrated Schema theorem , , and explores why the NFL results came as such a shock to the evolutionary computing commu­nity. Assuming that something like an evolutionary algorithm was responsible for the emergence and diversifcation of life, Culberson explores ways that evolution might escape some of the more damning implications of the NFL. For example, given that the universe is not as random as it could be, and that there is regularity and structure in physical laws, perhaps this restriction on possible problems is suffcient to escape application "

Leading research documents the potentially divergent impact of the introduction of automation technology, demonstrating how both job design how tasks are organized into jobs and employee’s possession or lack thereof of skills complementing newly introduced technologies contribute to eventual outcomes for companies and workers. Workers with indemand skills ready for augmentation may see their wages and job quality increase considerably. Conversely, even if automation only affects a subset of the tasks within their job role, workers lacking appropriate skills to adapt to new technologies and move on to higher value tasks may see their wages and job quality"
"Customers report that it can take – months to architect a new solution with software, hardware, PoC and vendor selection. Because each vendor focuses on its own piece, with little integration between hardware and software, customers must know servers, GPUs, networks and storage. From there, they must choose an operating system that is compatible with the machine and deep learning libraries and frameworks their data scientists use. Once it’s all assembled, improper integration and tuning can lead to failed jobs, software version incompatibilities or unbalanced configurations resulting in underutilized resources. And, each data scientist may have a unique combination of frameworks and libraries that they need for their work, making ongoing maintenance of the environment a complex and timeconsuming task.Dell EMC Ready Solutions for AI are validated, hardware and software stacks optimized to accelerate AI initiatives, shortening the time to architect a new solution by months.

"Cycling is vital to the HSC scenario, in part because cycling rates can grow dramatically in a very short amount of time and support a substantial percentage of trips. Over the long term, it may be possible for many cities to replicate the success of cycling in cities such as Groningen, Assen, and Amsterdam in the Neth­erlands, where cycling exceeds percent of all trips, and in Copenhagen in Denmark, which grew from low levels of cycling after World War II to more than percent of trips today.c, d Such cities have succeeded by providing seamless infrastructure and a host of supportive poli­cies to make cycling a safe, comfortable, and efficient option for a large number of trips. But in the short term, most efforts should be mod­eled after cities that have succeeded in rapidly growing cycling from very low levels, in some cases from near zero to more than percent mode share in just a few years. Seville, Spain, is particularly relevant, as it grew cycling mode share from. percent to near"

"Daimler give the reason why there are lack of voluntary practice in the labor rights reporting. Much of data requested by Global Reporting Initiative GRI G HR performance indicators are difficult to collect and not to be valued by the companies who asked to collect it, compared to the costs that they have to bear in order to get it. Another issue of labor rights reporting is uncertainty a company may not know if any of its operations are at risk of child labor, forced labor or lack of freedom of association, and may not want to publicize something that may be inherently uncertain and in any case, unpleasant. Finally, the selfdamning nature of some of the data, if in fact were collected, is surely offputting it is understandable that reporting number of incidents of discrimination and violation of the rights of indigenous people is unpalatable.

"Data and its underlying complexities have been an enterprise narrative since the earliest days of technology investment. The promise of analytics has been its close and even more tantalizing spiritual successor—taking advantage of that data to gen­erate insights about customers, citizens, markets, operations, and virtually every facet of how an en­terprise runs. Most analytics efforts have struggled to deliver on the simplest version of that potential the rearview mirror describing what has already happened—or, for the advanced few, presenting realtime views into what is currently happening. In the science of analytics, this is valuable but insufficient. Today companies need the ability to predict I have a good idea what will happen next and prescribe I can recommend a response. But this is no simple undertaking. Though analytics engines, algorithms, and supporting infrastructure have grown more powerful, the amount of data available for analysis has grown exponentially.

However, based on feedback acquired in this survey, few CFOs feel emboldened to embrace the potential of advanced data analytics due to a lack of technological and talentrelated resources.

"Declining voter turnout signals the deep problems democracies are facing today. Lower turnout suggests that fewer citizens consider elections the main instrument for legitimizing political parties’ control over political decisionmaking. It may even show that citizens are less interested in political parties as the main bodies of democratic representation as such. However, lower citizen participation in elections does not necessarily mean that citizens are becoming less active in politics. On the contrary, we have seen a rise in other forms of citizen activism, such as mass protests, occupy movements and increased use of social media as a new platform of political engagement. Such a shift in the channels of political participation, from voting for traditional bodies of representation to new forms of democratic participation and representation, puts serious pressure on governments and the way traditional political parties function. This is therefore the right time for governments and pol"

Findings from studies so far have generated hints that certain students may benefit more from social psychology interventions.

"Driving financial discrimination against the marginalized Algorithms have long been used to create credit scores and inform loan screening. However, with the rise of big data, systems are now using machine learning to incorporate and analyze nonfinancial data points to determine creditworthiness, from where people live, to their internet browsing habits, to their purchasing decisions. The outputs these systems produce are known as escores, and unlike formal credit scores they are largely unregulated. As data scientist Cathy O’Neil has pointed out, these scores are often discriminatory and create pernicious feedback loops. For example, a wouldbe borrower who lives in a rough part of town, where more people default on their loans, may be given a low score and targeted with financial products offering less credit and higher interest rates. This is because such systems group people together based on the observed habits of the majority. In this case, a responsible person trying to start a b"

"During humanitarian crises, social media users post messages, photos and videos to various social media platforms. The use of social media as a means for communication and a place to gather data remains an experimental field for humanitarian organizations. However, there is increasing recognition of social media’s potential to enhance contextual awareness. Given the large volume, velocity and variety of information expressed on social media sites, highlighting trends and correlations requires significant amounts of processing.

"During site visits, agencies referenced planning both before and after acquisition as an important facilitator of smooth implementation. Although agencies may not have had cohesive, longterm acquisition plans, many agencies reported taking time for indepth planning before acquisition and during implementation. These agencies conducted product research, vetted vendors, and explored the impact that technology would have in the field before acquisition. Agencies examined many factors, including cost, integration, complexity, shelf life, efficiency, effectiveness, and other technologyspecific concerns. At least nine of the agencies we visited, most of which were highimpact agencies, formed working groups to explore particular technology and conducted pilot studies or testing in the field. Several highimpact agencies emphasized the importance of researching or vetting different vendors.

"ECOMOMENTUMWhile consumers overwhelmingly agree that environmental progress will depend on changes in human behavior, many are still looking for guidance on how and where to improve their environmental footprint. Changing lifelong habits is hard, but it may be the small changes that help make the biggest difference. Identity is not a fixed thing—there are many variables that influence how we see ourselves and think about our role in the world — and ultimately that influences how we behave. This includes what we buy, wear and drive — and what we choose to show on social media, which has become not just a platform to express ourselves, but also a way to define ourselves. And yet — if you post it, is it true? How big is the gap between our public and private images? MANY FACES OF METhe way we compartmentalize work has changed, and in the race for talent, companies are increasingly acknowledging a fundamental truth — employees don’t live to work, they work to live.

"Economic power alone is not sufficient to define the global balance of power however, economic strength is the foundation of military power. Therefore, change in defence spending is an important factor for military power. In the AsiaPacific, Eastern Europe and the Middle East, military expenditure has grown steadily in recent years. The United States, with total expenditure of billion in , remains by far the world’s largest military spender, at nearly three times the level of China, which is ranked second. Chinese defence expenditure reached around billion in. Although Russia’s defence spending declined to billion in due to falling oil and gas prices and economic sanctions, Russia remains one of the top spenders in terms of the share of GDP spent on defence. While defence spending in Western and Central Europe stagnated billion, Eastern Europe observed an increase in billion. It should also be noted that in , NATO Allies declared increased defence spending in real terms. Even so, the p"
"EDTD utilizes a cloudbased sandboxing technology to detect new, neverbeforeseen types of threats, and thus provides an additional layer of security to ESET products, such as Mail Security and Endpoint products. This sandbox consists of multiple types of sensors that complete static analysis of code, deep inspection of the sample with machine learning, inmemory introspection and behaviorbased detection. Compared to Endpoint, EDTD represents a much more powerful detection engine that leverages a wider range of technologies and access to the vast collection of clean, potentially unwanted and malicious items collected by ESET in the past years. It is much more effective to run such a solution in the cloud, making it more scalable and lowering demands on the customer’s infrastructure.For years, ESET® has been developing industryleading IT security software and services for businesses and consumers worldwide.

"Education is the most important factor in youth development, which has primary links with employment and standard of living. To measure it YDI uses indicators enrolment in secondary education, literacy rate and digital native rate. However, these three indicators are not enough to provide sufficient evidence. First of all, in addition to ‘enrolment in secondary education’, it might be also necessary to include ‘completion’, ‘attendance’ or ‘dropout’ indicators. For example, report on the impact of cash transfers by the Overseas Development Institute emphasizes that enrolment in secondary education does not always mean its completion, and that is the reason researchers also collected data on school attendance. Researchers also studied the learning outcomes and provided data on test scores, which helped to reveal more comprehensive understanding of education. Although it might be problematic to measure learning outcomes, ODI report shows its possibility. Secondly, such indicator as ‘know"

The good news is that businesses across functions want to be more proactive and implement a more progressive approach to fraud risk management that balances detection with the customer experience. Who can help align these goals to ultimately benefit the consumer? Businesses lean on IT when making decisions for investing in both fraud risk management and customer experience solutions Figure. Considering all of the teams directly and indirectly involved, IT serves a critical role in bringing multiple solutions together. However, these teams require time and resources to integrate new solutions.

"Employment relationships are presumed to be “atwill” in all U.S. states except Montana. The atwill employment doctrine allows the employer to establish the parameters of the employment relationship i.e., job duties, including any oncall responsibilities. Unless an employee is covered by an employment contract for a specific length of time, subject to a collective bargaining agreement as a union member, works for certain public sector employers, or an exception to the atwill doctrine applies see below, the employee may be discharged from employment at the will of the employer. Likewise, an employee is generally free to leave the job at any time for any or no reason with no adverse legal consequences. Courts have ruled that the employer may make changes to the employment relationship and that an employee may be fired for their unwillingness to take oncall duty, even if not required to take oncall when hired.,Staff sonographers reported an average of hours of oncall time in a typical week"

For example, the Confessions of a FirstTime Operagoer series lacked behindthescenes detail, and although it was watched by a broader audience, it did not augment the experience for many viewers. Moreover the visual element of vid­eos added an extra punch Audioonly podcasts taking audiences behind the scenes were not as popular and enhanced the opera experience less. Respondents in focus groups at the beginning of the initiative, described in “Research to Re.ne the Tools” on page , found that, because opera is such a visual art form, audioonly applications were not as compelling.

"Energy leaders clearly believe that technology, in its many forms, is the key to a decarbonised energy future. In particular, advances in electric storage and renewable energy are key areas that have the potential to dictate the pace and the scale of the energy transition. The rapid implementation of renewable energy capacity across the globe, notably wind and solar PV, means that there is a degree of certainty about the future role of renewable energy in the global energy mix. However, its impact is growing as renewable energy displaces hydrocarbons, particularly oil and coal, in power genera­tion. In turn, the anticipated improvement in electric storage, notably batteries, has the potential to revolutionise the transport sector as the electric vehicles EVs become a viable alternative to petrol and diesel fuelled cars. Factors that could further dampen the growth in energy demand growth such as energy efficiency and the end to energy subsidies remain high on the agenda of global energ"

"Enhancing the perceptual capabilities of AI systems Perception is an intelligent system’s window into the world. Perception begins with possibly distributed sensor data, which comes in diverse modalities and forms, such as the status of the system itself or information about the environment. Sensor data are processed and fused, often along with a priori knowledge and models, to extract information relevant to the AI system’s task such as geometric features, attributes, location, and velocity. Integrated data from perception forms situational awareness to provide AI systems with the comprehensive knowledge and a model of the state of the world necessary to plan and execute tasks effectively and safely. AI systems would greatly benefit from advancements in hardware and algorithms to enable more robust and reliable perception. Sensors must be able to capture data at longer distances, with higher resolution, and in real time. Perception systems need to be able to integrate data from a vari"
"Ensuring sufficient supply of valuable medical isotopes. One of the most breathtaking developments in cancer treatment is recent success in trials that treat metastasized latestage prostate cancer with the use of the alphaemitting isotope Actinium Ac. The DOE Isotope Program formed a TriLaboratory Collaboration of scientists at Brookhaven, Los Alamos, and Oak Ridge National Laboratories to develop largescale production capacity of Ac to ensure sufficient supply and help advance the promising medical uses of this isotope. In addition, DOE’s National Nuclear Security Administration NNSA helped ensure a reliable supply of a vital medical isotope, which resulted in approval by FDA of the first domestically produced, nonuranium based molybdenum Mo. Mo is the most widely used radioisotope in medical diagnostic imaging. One of NNSA’s partners developed the RadioGenixTM System and neutron capture process to produce Mo without the use of highly enriched uranium. Until now, the United States has"
"Environmental labelling is, according to ISO , a set of voluntary tools aiming at stimulating demand of products and services with minor environmental costs offering relevant information on its lifecycle in order to satisfy environmental information demand from the purchasers’ side. The environmental impact and effects of products requesting ecolabelling are determined through a LifeCycle Assessment –LCA– evaluating its interactions with the environment, including energy and natural resources.

"Ewaste management started in Korea in , with the inclusion of TVs and washing machines under the Producer DepositRefund scheme. Airconditioners and refrigerators were also included in later years of the programme, which regulated other types of wastes as well such as packaging. The deposit, paid by manufacturers to a fund regulated by the Korean Recycling Corporation KORECO, was paid back to the manufacturer on proof of proper recycling of ewaste. In practice however, the refund rate was less than per cent as the deposit was hardly claimed by manufacturers, as it was cheaper than the cost of recycling.

"Existing system of oil production taxation in Russia is based primarily on such fiscal instruments as mineral extraction tax and export duties. The greater part of tax burden falls on the oil production companies and the taxes are levied on these companies’ sales of oil.

"Figure illustrates that Canada ranks first in terms of tertiary education attainment, with percent of the to population. Canada, however, is well down the list when it comes to vocational education attainment, with only per cent. In Germany, Poland and Hungary, the share of the population with vocational education attainment is at or above per cent. This analysis suggests that many of the countries identified with significant construction labour demands also have welleducated populations and, in many cases, much larger proportions of the population that have attained vocational training. This suggests meeting skilled trades demands is relatively more challenging in Canada compared to many European countries. Although there is no directly comparable vocational attainment statistics for the United States, the higher proportion of upper secondary and nontertiary to tertiary suggests a larger share of the working population is available to meet demands for skilled trades occupations.Table "

"Figure. reveals a positive relationship between the actual teacher’s wage and student outcomes, and suggests that the relationship could be non­linear. However, it is also clear that there are country outliers, like China and Russia, where students’ outcomes are good despite teachers having low wages. Conversely, countries like Switzerland and Germany perform well on PISA but have very high teacher’s wages. These conclusions are clarified by examining the regression results in Table. Here we examine the correlation between average PISA scores and Teacher’s actual pay and the Teacher Status Index. We see that the relationship between PISA scores and teacher’s wage is quite robust and gets stronger if it is estimated non­linearly. Based on these results there is good evidence that higher teacher pay is positively associated with higher average PISA scores. It would also appear that there is a clear relationship between GTSI and PISA scores. This is clear in the multiple regression result"

"Finally, our analysis also reveals the beginnings of a politicisation or polarisation in the way that AI is covered. Rather than sides of a single issue, this politicisation concerns the topics that different outlets see as constituting artificial intelligence itself. Even so, it is important not to overstate this incipient politicisation. All six outlets cover a range of topics, and, as shown above, there remain notable similarities in the ways they cover AI. The key difference lies in the topics outlets choose to emphasise. We have shown how rightleaning outlets consider AI through questions of economics, business, and national security – topics long prioritised by the Conservative party. Similarly, leftleaning outlets emphasise questions of ethics, discrimination, and privacy – reading AI through long standing concerns over labour relations and social justice. This growing politicisation is at least partly a function of the UK’s politically divided news landscape Newman et al., in w"

Numbers are still relatively low with evidence of VEOs radicalising or recruiting others in detention environments and the risk of postrelease recidivism often anecdotal rather than based on substantial qualitative and quantitative data. Mark Hamm described it best when coining the term ‘the spectacular few’ building on more than years of prison research, he concludes that only a small minority of the inmate population is at risk of engaging in terrorist activities during or after imprisonment. Nevertheless, recent research analysing profiles of European violent extremists with criminal pasts concluded that of them had been incarcerated prior to their radicalisation with of them being judged to have gone through this process during their time in prison.

"Following Montana’s enactment of a tax haven blacklist, the Multistate Tax Commission MTC took a similar approach in. In that year, the MTC adopted its Model Combined Reporting Statute that included within the water’sedge tax base the income of members doing business in a tax haven country. The Statute defined “tax haven” as a “jurisdiction that, during the tax year in question.is identified by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD as a tax haven.” At the same time, the MTC adopted a “criteria” list, adding to the tax base any income of companies doing business in a country that met the “criteria”. However, three years later in , the MTC recognized the problem of linking to an OECD tax haven list that was largely abandoned by the OECD itself. The Executive Committee of the MTC instructed its Uniformity Committee to consider whether changes should be made to the definition of “tax haven” in the MTC’s Model Combined Reporting Statute.

Furthermore, ROC and AUC metrics are not necessarily indicative of clini­cal utility or even the best way to express accuracy of the model’s performance,. Furthermore, many of these reports still only exist in preprint form and have not appeared in peerreviewed pub­lications.

"For example, in credit scoring, the customer with a long history of maintaining loans without delinquency or default is generally determined as “low risk.” However, what may be unseen is that the mortgages of this customer have been maintained and supported by substantial tax benefits that are set to expire. A spike in defaults may be in the offing, unaccounted for in the statistical risk model of the lending institution. With access to the right data and guidance by subject matter experts, predictive machinelearning models could find the hidden patterns in the data and correct for such spikes. Even more, outside of business decisions, algorithmic bias can cause errors that could spark some real problems and unrest among citizens. For example, Google’s Photos service and others services like it are used to identify people, objects, and scenes, but can go terribly wrong, such as when a camera missed the mark on racial sensitivity, or when a software used for risk assessments to predict "

"from the budding trade war between the United States and China. According to one Manilabased developer “The Philippines is a largely domestic market that doesn’t export a lot, so trade issues don’t usually affect us. But we could soon see more Chinese companies shifting operations here to avoid U.S. tariffs.” Interviewees operating in several emergingmarket countries reported that this process was already underway, with demand in local industrial and business parks surging as Chinese companies take up space. In this way, the trade war has proved a catalyst for a process already underway.

"Given the ubiquity of global virtual teamwork we cannot overstate the magnitude of the challenge that virtual work introduces to productivity. As human beings, we are endowed with multiple senses and forms of expression that we rely on in our interpersonal communication. When deprived of some of that sensory input and forms of expression, we must compensate. In the virtual work world, we are deprived of using all our senses. Consequently, the information we receive from the senses that are being used must be amplified and translated. When we apply this situation to a team consisting of people from multiple cultures with different personal styles, the challenge grows exponentially. To be successful in the global arena, however, each person must become a proficient and effective virtual worker. This survey demonstrates that a large segment of the global workforce is operating at a disadvantage for a consequential portion of their work.When examining these challenges, we’re struck by how "

"How AI is perceived by the public can have significant impact on how it is developed, deployed and regulated. Some commentators argue that perceptions are currently distorted or extreme. This paper discusses the results of a nationally representative survey of the UK population on their perceptions of AI. The survey solicited responses to eight common narratives about AI four optimistic, four pessimistic, plus views on what AI is, how likely it is to impact in respondents’ lifetimes, and whether they can influence it. of respondents offered a plausible definition of AI, while thought it meant robots. Of the narratives presented, those associated with automation were best known, followed by the idea that AI would become more powerful than humans. Overall results showed that the most common visions of the impact of AI elicit significant anxiety. Only two of the eight narratives elicited more excitement than concern AI making life easier, and extending life. Respondents felt they had no c"
"How countries deal with such increased budget pressure will influence overall national savings. At one extreme, countries may maintain social insurance tax rates and cut benefits. At another extreme, they may maintain benefits and increase taxes. As the authors note, the literature predicts that the latter approach will weaken national savings relative to the first, possibly leading to a situation in which population ageing is not associated with an increase in the capitallabour ratio. The simple reasoning is that in the second case, resources are being taken from generations with a longer horizon and a lower marginal propensity to consume these resources the young, rather than the old. Indeed, a policy having an even stronger negative effect on national savings would be one that neither cuts benefits nor raises taxes, but uses additional public borrowing to finance existing benefits, as these resources will come ultimately from those future generations that currently engage in no cons"
"How many rates should there be? Some countries have a single national rate or some differentiated but unique regional rates. This is usually the case in large andor decentralised countries. Brazil, for example, has a federal rate and some higher rates in a few richer states. Other countries have multiple rates which can vary by industry, occupation or both. This is more frequently the case in countries with weak systems of collective bargaining and where the minimum wage attempts to mimic or substitute for the outcomes of industrylevel collective bargaining. While there are many good reasons to have multiple rates, it should be noted that too many rates tend to result in confusion about applicability and in poor compliance. Both Mexico and Costa Rica, for example, have tried to reduce the number of their rates. Mexico managed to progressively eliminate different regional rates, while Costa Rica reduced its number of occupational rates. Finally, lower rates for trainees or workers durin"
"However, in reality, reaching these goals may be challenging because of variations in the production of the workforce e.g. numbers of schools and faculties of pharmacy and the lag time between educating and deploying staff leaving lower income countries with chronically low numbers in comparison with higher income countries. In addition, an important factor in understanding the demand for pharmacists is consideration of workforce drivers and the impact of the pharmacy support and technician workforce. The influential FIP report†††† that focused on the pharmacy support cadres clearly indicated that utilisation of pharmacy technicians and other pharmacy support workers is often driven by gaps or demands for pharmacists. In lower income countries, particularly in rural areas with acute limitations of access to pharmacist services, pharmacy technicians carry out roles to support safer access to medicines. In higher income countries, pharmacy technicians tend to fulfil roles that allow phar"

"However, since some organizations may determine that paying a ransom is the necessary course of action for a given incident, and Bitcoin is the most common form of payment request, it is recommended that organizations set up a Bitcoin wallet in advance. This type of proactive planning is not unlike establishing relationships in advance with crisis management firms, forensics specialists and law enforcement – it is easier to make logical, informed decisions during the calm than it is during the storm. There are several sites that compare wallets and approaches as well as the security considerations related to cryptocurrency wallets. Since many ransom situations have tight deadlines, setting up a digital wallet in advance and holding some cryptocurrency there allows an organization to respond quickly.

Also, further research is needed on technologytransfer measures given their potential to be distortive, given that they offer financial benefits and often target specific firms, sectors or technologies.

"Humans are smart, achieving intelligence through years of learning and data accumulation as well as arguably getting “wiser” with age. Computers could be considered “smart” due to data retention capabilities but until recently lacked the capability to autonomously learn from these large databases in order to execute tasks or make decisions. While a human brain consumes W of power, the latest learning systems are consuming power at levels that would support a small town as they learn to become artificially intelligent.

"IDB Invest has worked with a fund management company—a Brazilian fund manager that has no more than employees —on its gender equality strategy. In order to draft the strategy, the company was encouraged to take the WEPs Tool, demonstrating the ability for the WEPs tool to serve small companies in the very early stages of their gender equality journey. Its results showed the need to work on the formalization of its commitment to women’s empowerment and gender equality as well as its policies and processes. IDB Invest has advised the fund on the definition of a gender action plan directed at establishing an equal opportunity policy, a clear policy on how to address sexual harassment and the establishment of a grievance mechanism and a recruitment policy that specifically prohibits inquiring about marriage, pregnancy andor caring responsibilities.

"If Europe is serious about having its own AI champions, it must not only facilitate the creation of startups but also enable the most promising ones to scale up and remain European. Many observers believe the issue of funding for startups will soon be resolved. Europe has undeniably made progress in this area. But startups working in AI need larger investments than their peers in other fields. This is because their fixed costs are high due to the need for data collection and aggregation, computing power and human resources. The upward pressure on salaries for the best talent – developers as well as Chief Technology Officers – and the expense of internationalization exac­erbate their capital needs. This is particularly true in the initial development and launch phases, which are espe­cially laborintensive. Yet, despite the growth of the investment market, access to funding for European AI startups remains limited. So far, there has been no largescale fundraising exceeding USD million by"
"If the latter is true, service providers have an opportunity to use technology to extend their services, perhaps using a lightertouch option, to larger numbers of families. Of the parents we spoke to, those who were able to attend onsite services such as playgroups or parenting classes only did so for a limited time. Once they were unable to attend the programming, they no longer had a connection to the provider or the other attendees. Technologies like Skype are being used by homevisiting programs to connect with families. Ridesharing services could be developed for people who do not have access to reliable transportation. WhatsApp groups or Facebook groups could keep the conversation going once families have left the building. Organizations should take into account how their families already interact with technology as they plan strategies for using technology to extend their services.

"If you want to delight your customers, you need to know who they are, based on both quantitative and qualitative data. Marketers should think about the different stages of the customer journey, and carry out extensive testing to see what types of communication and messaging at different touchpoints result in the best outcomes. Companies should be aspiring to target content and messaging based on individual customer preferences and behaviour, inferred from both explicit and implicit data. In order to deliver a great customer experience, it is crucial to have the right content readily available.

They absorb a growing share of the economy’s resources – for example, the human labor they employ, the raw materials that go into computing and data centers, and the electricity they consume server farms absorb close to of the world’s electricity production, by some estimates. They also accumulate rising levels of wealth. And although they are notionally owned by humans, the defacto level of control exerted by their owners is rather low.

"In addition to tuition and fees, we report room and board charges for residential students, living costs for commuter students, and other components of student budgets. Whether students live on or off campus, they must pay for housing and food, buy books and supplies, and cover transportation and other basic living costs. Many of these expenses are not really additional costs associated with attending college, but are expenses people face whether or not they are in school. It is very difficult to succeed in college while working full time. However, the cost of students’ time is difficult to measure, and we make no attempt to do so in this report. Because students tend to think of living expenses as part of the cost of going to college, and because they must come up with the funds to cover these outlays, it is useful to use these expenses as a proxy for forgone earnings. The cost of living poses a significant hurdle for many students. Even those who receive grant aid sufficient to cover"

"In fact, a number of social policies are feasible and affordable even for countries at fairly low levels of income UNRISD a World Bank b. Evidence from across the world suggests that poverty levels are considerably reduced after social protection programmes have been implemented, with the most significant reductions occurring in countries with comprehensive social policies that aim at universal access and coverage in social protection, education, health care and other services. The Universal Coverage Scheme in Thailand, for example, has provided universal access to health care including general medical care, inpatient care and rehabilitation services, and in just years it reduced the proportion of the population without health coverage from percent to less than percent WHO , with people living in poverty having benefited most. Another remarkable example is the experience of Rwanda, a postconflict country that achieved substantial health gains from universal coverage, after the governme"

"In Latin America, companies are innovating and leading the way in minimising plastic packaging. YVY, a home care brand launched in in Brazil, is attempting to make the way consumers clean their homes more sustainable. The brand has designed a capsule system, like a coffeepod, for cleaning products. Consumers sign up to a monthly subscription box, containing capsules delivered to their door. They are then inserted into reusable bottles with nozzles to spray and clean various items and surfaces. Once the capsule containing the cleaning product is empty, consumers can post the empty pods back to YVY free of charge to be recycled and reused. The system allows for a significant reduction in the amount of water used in the cleaning process and hence, the amount of plastic packaging. With a range of products for degreasing, dishwashing and multipurpose cleaning, the company has already seen sales success and hopes to create a ‘green cleaning’ segment within the Brazilian home care industry.Ve"

"In our study of recent SEC staff comments, we analyzed the comment letters that were issued to certain early adopters of Accounting Standards Codification ASC and ASC that may indicate the types of comments the SEC staff will issue to registrants that adopted the standard this year. As expected, the SEC staff’s comments on the application of ASC and ASC have focused on areas of judgment. Based on what we have seen, registrants appear to have been able to resolve these comments in the same manner they have resolved comments on other topics. That is, the registrants have helped the SEC staff gain a better understanding of the judgments made by management or agreed to provide additional disclosures in future filings.

Other third party submissions to the ACCCs Digital Platforms Inquiry raised similar concerns and encouraged the ACCC to take action. The purpose of this submission is to outline a number of remedy options that News Corp Australia considers the ACCC should either take itself or actively support and recommend to the Government in order to address the harm being caused. This is particularly the case in relation to Google. Google has become an unavoidable trading partner for consumers, media content providers and advertisers alike.

"In some cases, credential stuffing isn’t background noise it comes as an avalanche of traffic that looks a lot like a DDoS attack. It might be that the attacker doesn’t care about being detected and doesn’t care if the botnet it’s using will get reported and potentially shut down. Or it might be that the bot herder doesn’t understand its tools and forgot to enable throttling to keep the botnet quiet. A third option is that the attack really is an attempt at DDoS — but if that was the goal, there are better ways to use a botnet to achieve it. Even if the real reason is one, all, or none of these explanations, any time login attempts more than triple to a site, the administrators are almost certain to notice and take action!The first example highlights the traffic that a large financial services institution in North America sees on a daily basis.

"In terms of retroactive UCG, massive volumes of content are also created every second of every day as a result of users providing information online about their lives and their experiences. The key difference from the proactive modes is that users are not voluntarily opting into specific systems for the purpose of sharing information on particular topics and issues. There are many different types of retroactive UGC that could be used for urban research including Internet search terms, customer ratings, web usage data, and trends data. Data from social networks, microblogs or social media streams have generated a lot of interest among researchers, with the dominant services at the current time being online social networks such as Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn, and Foursquare, the latter being a locationbased social network.

"In the aftermath of Brexit which changed the international environment as the EU states started to initiate dis­cussions about the future of Europe, Fico stated that Bratislava should be part of a deeply integrated EU “core” driven by Germany and France Jancarikova, Hence, as the situation changed, Bratisla­va altered its interests. Though, the unfa­vourable image of Visegrad had an impact on the recognition of Bratislava foreign policy actions. Wanting to reestablish the trust and previous relations with the EU, Slovakia introduced the concept of “flexible solidarity” which should have had been a replacement for the quota system. “Flexible solidarity” was based on the principle that the distribution mecha­nism of refugees should be voluntary, and that it should be up to countries to decide how they want to contribute in emergen­cy situations. The heads of governments of the V countries supported the idea of “flexible solidarity” on migration poli­cy. In September in Bratislava, they e"
"In the case of shortterm highcost consumer credit, one of the main issues identified by a number of CAs is the continuing increase in the number of sales of these products. Some CAs reported that these loans are increasingly provided online or through mobile applications and that the steps and procedures of the granting process are minimised in order to increase the speed at which the consumer receives the funds. The cost of these credits has been observed as much higher than the cost of other ordinary personal loans, due to, inter alia, a higher estimated default risk. Many of these loans were considered to be ‘preapproved’that the steps and procedures of the granting process are minimised in order to increase the speed at which the consumer receives the funds.

"In the current economic situation Russian consumers have focused on cheaper brands and national brands, which are actively supported and promoted successfully in various Internet reviews. The Internet has become a powerful tool for the collection and analysis of information on cosmetic products, as well as comparing the prices of various types of cosmetics. The role of online resources in the sale of cosmetics is still one of the most important. In this regard, producers should focus on the creation of quality online content that will be of interest to consumers both in the planning process and in the process of shopping cosmetics. This step will allow to attract potential buyers to the physical point of sale as well as ensure loyalty to the brand manufacturer.I think Thai cosmetic products can be very competitive on the Russian market. Especially those which are made of natural ingredients. Considering that buyers are looking for natural and not very expensive cosmetics Thai products "
"In the early ’s, the NGO sector was also experimenting with using bulk SMS to distribute urgent news updates and callstoaction. The devastating earthquake that struck Haiti in then gave rise to texttogive technology. For the next few years, NGOs were eager to experiment with SMS and texttogive campaigns, but by most NGOs were losing interest. Like the first generation of mobile apps developed by NGOs, the first SMS and texttogive campaigns failed because NGOs lacked a comprehensive mobile strategy. In mobile apps and in text messages, NGOs were linking to web and donation pages that were not mobilecompatible, thus ineffective. Currently, only of NGOs worldwide regularly send text messages to donors and supporters. In the future, it will be interesting to see if innovation in SMS and texttogive technology can renew the NGO sector’s interest in launching SMS and texttogive campaigns.Even more impactful upon the NGO sector was the rise of social networks.

How do you move from designing around content, graphics, and buttons to recognizing what a customer is asking, maintaining the context of the conversation, providing relevant responses, and executing actions for the customer? More importantly, how do you communicate with customers in the way that they describe financial concepts and terms? In the past, digital experiences took a user down a steep path to find an answer. This assumed the customer has enough knowledge and patience to make the right choices throughout the digital journey to find the answer.

"In the U.S., there is no singular, comprehensive data privacy law, but rather a patchwork of sectorspecific privacy protections. Although these laws were not drafted with AI systems in mind, companies will need to be mindful of the restrictions such laws may place on specific AI projects, which may need to track certain individual level activity or functions over time. For example, the healthcare industry is a ripe target for AI innovation, as AI products may help improve the speed and accuracy of diagnoses and refine and tailor treatment plans. Achieving these outcomes may require tracking individuals’ treatment and response over time. However, obtaining the medical data necessary for training AI may be a challenge, as the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA places restrictions on how health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and healthcare providers can use and disclose protected health information. State medical privacy laws may similarly restrict access"

"In this sense, the current moment contains not only danger, but also opportunity for democracy. Those committed to human rights and democratic gover­nance should not limit themselves to a wary defense of the status quo. Instead we should throw ourselves into projects intended to renew national and interna­tional orders, to make protections for human dignity even more just and more comprehensive, including for workers whose lives are disrupted by technological and economic change. Democracy requires contin­uous effort to thrive, and a constant willingness to broaden and deepen the application of its principles. The future of democracy depends on our ability to show that it is more than a set of bareminimum defenses against the worst abuses of tyrants—it is a guarantee of the freedom to choose and live out one’s own destiny.

"Innovation in logistics and technology in fresh food, is increasingly focused on the speed of the supply chain. The objective is to develop supply chains that are fast, flexible, transparent and precise. One of the most difficult agrifood products to handle are fruit and vegetables as they have a relatively short shelf life and can deteriorate rapidly. These products require supply chain objectives to be achieved if the product is to reach its destination in prime condition. The organisation “Fruit Logistica” commissioned a report that looks at how the four objectives of fast, flexible, transparent and precise supply chains could be achieved. To create faster supply chains, elimination of inefficiencies is needed, requiring an end to end view of the entire supply chain. Duplication of effort needs to be removed, scheduling requests to be precisely coordinated so product is always on the move to its destination, this implies a collaborative working approach.

For example, large global institutional investors often push for companies to have at least three independent directors, but in Japan, the concept of independence is relatively new and not understood in a Western context. Instead of focusing on precise compliance with this standard, institutional investors are focused on more immediate remedies, such as ensuring that the board is not composed of any directors who are former senior executives from the same company and looking for other signs of board accountability, as evidenced by independent thinking and the board’s ability to effectively challenge management.

"International organisations are also using immersive technology to surface public input for designing communities. The United Na­tions Human Settlements Programme UNHabitat has partnered with the companies Microsoft and Mojang to develop Block by Block, an innovative project that leverages the popular computer game Minecraft to simply and easily engage community members, such as children, the elderly, urban poor and refugees, who are not usually heard from when planning public spaces. Minecraft is a game where users within a virtual world are equipped with dif­ferent kinds of D blocks to build new structures and bring their ideas to life.

"Interviewed organizations face an imperative to maximize the value of the talents and skills of their IT staffs given budget constraints and challenges in finding IT talent. Before undertaking their IT modernization initiatives, IT teams spent more time managing dispersed and siloed infrastructure and responding to more frequent problems and outages, struggled to provide sufficient levels of security, and often could not ensure that IT operations met the speed of their businesses. In total, such inefficiencies exert a significant cost on IT operations, representing the cost of staff time that could be better used in innovating, driving new projects, or supporting business expansion. IDC calculates that IT teams at these organizations are more productive with IT modernization see Table , thereby increasing the value of their IT teams by. million per organization , per users per year see Figure , which represents a reduction of technical debt worth of their total annual IT budgets.Study "

The first issue related to a lack of expectationsetting among the incoming students. The first cohort of students studying under the IEP were reported to be unprepared for the levels of openended problem solving and selfdirected learning they experienced “there was definitely a cultureshock of ‘why can’t they just give us the answers?’” The second issue centered around the integration and crossfertilization of core IEP components, particularly with respect to the DPS module. Although delivered as a standalone module, DPS was designed to closely integrate with the students’ learning throughout the Scenarios and Challenges, such that they were able to learn, reflect upon and apply their professional skills in authentic contexts. During early iterations of the IEP, however, this integration proved challenging, and the experiences of "

"Linear, monotonic functions Response functions created by linear regression algorithms are probably the most popular, accountable, and transparent class of machine learning models. These models will be referred to here as linear and monotonic. They are transparent because changing any given input feature or sometimes a combination or function of an input feature changes the response function output at a de.ned rate, in only one direction, and at a magnitude represented by a readily available coe.cient. Monotonicity also enables accountability through intuitive, and even automatic, reasoning about predictions. For instance, if a lender rejects a credit card application, they can say exactly why because their probability of default model often assumes that credit scores, account balances, and the length of credit history are linearly and monotonically related to the ability to pay a credit card bill. When these explanations are created automatically and listed in plain English, they are "

"Managing two different types of functions in an organization can be challenging, but a few principles illustrate the shift in mind­set necessary to make this work. Companies should view employees fundamentally as resources of the organization rather than as resources of the manager. This is why the military developed the parallel ideas of administrative control and operational control. Administrative control refers to the employee’s home structure and to how an employee is developed and supported, the home to which an employee returns when a teambased project is finished. Operational control, by contrast, refers to the process of ensuring that the mission to which an employee is assigned is accomplished successfully. By its nature, it includes performance management for the employee during that period.This publication contains general information only, and none of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, its member firms, or its and their affiliates are, by means of this publication, renderin"
"Many claim that the occasional autonomous vehicle fatality needs to be put in the context of the existing ecosystem, in which many drivingrelated deaths happen without AI. However, because regulations and liability regimes govern humans and machines differently, risks generated from machinehuman interactions do not cleanly fall into a discrete regulatory or accountability category. Strong incentives for regulatory and jurisdictional arbitrage exist in this and many other AI domains. For example, the fact that Phoenix serves as the site of Waymo and Uber testing is not an accident. Early this year, Arizona, perhaps swayed by a promise of technology jobs and capital, made o.cial what the state allowed in practice since fully autonomous vehicles without anyone behind the wheel are permitted on public roads. This policy was put in place without any of the regulatory scaffolding that would be required to contend with the complex issues that are raised in terms of liability and accountabilit"
"Many good innovative solutions exist within and across governments, however it is often difficult to systematise the diffusion of innovation because potential innovators have no actual tools to help them replicate good ideas. To overcome this challenge, the National Centre for Public Sector Innovation COI in Denmark has developed Spreading Innovation, a stepbystep guide to help replicate innovations in new contexts. Launched in , the guide is freely available online. It provides a simplified overview of the innovation process, suggests actions for individual stakeholders, and provides a series of guiding questions that can support dialogue between people who want to share an innovation and people who want to adapt it to a new context. The guide makes it more manageable for governments to work systematically to spread innovation.Replicating innovations with the support of experienced people is expected to facilitate the process and reduce the costs associated with innovations.

"Medical humanerrors cost society billions of dollars in the US and around the world. A recent estimate claims that measurable medical errors in the US accrued to US. billion dollars in. Many of these errors can be prevented by applying current arti.cial intelligence techniques, e.g. machine learning, on existing medical data in order to predict these highrisk error situations. Since most of the settings leading to humaninduced errors are known and wellstudied, predicting and preventing them is more attainable. Using US and Peruvian ICU data, we develop, demonstrate, and discuss how machine learning models could possibly aid in identifying and preventing medical humanerrors. We propose that arti.cial intelligence is most valuable in helping prevent or reduce medical humanerrors when doctors must make decisions where clinical trials are lacking, providing some guidance and support to doctors grounded in historical data.We develop several diuretics propensity models by running logistic re"

"Mitigate ethical risks and avoid AI decision making. AI is susceptible to bias because of how it is programmed andor trained, or if the data inputs are already corrupted. A best practice for lessening bias is to involve multidisciplinary and diverse teams, in addition to ethicists, in all AI efforts. In addition, Matt Chessen, an AI researcher with the US Department of State, has recommended a new public policy profession that specializes in machine learning and data science ethics. Governments can also leverage the work of groups of technologists who have come together to create com­mon sets of ethics for AI, such as the Asilomar AI Principles and the Partnership on AI. Given the ethical issues surrounding AI and continuing developments in machine learning techniques, AI should not be tasked with making critical government deci­sions about citizens. For example, the use of a riskscoring system used in criminal sentencing and similar AI applications in the criminal justice system were "

"Mobile operators have increased the amount of data they offer consumers with plans in. Some of these plans include data caps in excess of GB. Competition is fueling the increase, as operators like to keep up with their peers in offering “the most data” for marketing purposes. With mobile penetration reaching a saturation point in many countries across all regions, the strategy until was the implementation of tiered plans as a way to monetize data and effectively manage or throttle the top users of traffic. While the top percent of the users continue to consume less data in comparison to five years ago, there has been a resurgence in unlimited plans. In general, data caps affect a larger percentage of mobile users than fixed users. On the fixed networks, data caps continue to increase to match subscribers’ growing appetite for video.

"Mobility AI technologies are enabling advanced mobility in robots. Whilst robots have been mobile for over years the first Automated Guided Vehicle was introduced in , AI enables robot mobility in unpredictable environments. Mobile robots have traditionally been programmed to execute a specific set of manoeuvres in a linear fashion, guided by signals magnetic, laser, lidar from devices installed for this purpose in their environment. They have not traditionally been programmed to deal with unexpected events – for example, if they encounter an obstacle, they can stop to avoid collision, but they will not be able to find an alternative route to their goal. In contrast, an AIenabled mobile robot gets from A to B by building a realtime map or updating a preprogrammed map in realtime of its environment and of its location within that environment, planning a path to the programmed goal, sensing obstacles and replanning a path insitu.

"Model monitoring ensures AI models continue to function as intended after deployment into production. Model monitoring should include the following four processes. active monitoring,. performance drift,. operational bias review, and. model re­training. Active monitoring tracks user behavior to identify irregular patterns that may indicate signs of unintended consequences. Performance drift monitors model KPIs to determine model performance and triggers a retraining process. Operational bias review tracks model inputs and outputs to identify irregularities which may indicate bias. Model retraining uses new data to account for changes in user behavior. By using a combination of these methods, you can more readily spot and correct irregularities or bias in your results.AI uses machine learning algorithms and realtime data to improve continuously. However, the selfcorrecting aspect of this process should not be left solely to the machines. Selfchanging, datadriven processes need human work"

Iran’s reentry into the oil export market won’t help tanker operators directly, because most of the oil will likely be shipped in National Iranian Tanker Company carriers sidelined in the Persian Gulf while sanctions were imposed. While adding a halfmillion barrels a day does not add much to the global supply—Saudi Arabia and the United States both produce million barrels per day—those extra barrels should further depress already weak oil prices inflating nearterm demand for oil, gas, and petroleum products and helping global shipping overall.China has contributed to the end of the commodity supercycle.

"Much of the th century can be accurately summed up as an aerospace arms race. The United States was not always the clear, unambiguous leader. For example, the U.S. never fielded a U.S.designed airplane in WWI, and the U.S. was notably behind Germany and the United Kingdom in early jet engine technology. However, The United States set the pace in many technological and operational domains and generally caught up rapidly in those instances when an adversary jumped ahead with a technological breakthrough. Though European aerospace industries had an edge during World War One and immediately prior to World War Two, the United States’ overall record is best in class. The U.S. was first to invent the air­plane in the early s, first to cross the Atlantic in the late s, and first to the moon in the s. Even in the most famous instances of the United States being behind in aerospace—the early days of the Space Race—the deficit was less severe than is popularly imagined. When the Soviets were firs"

"National sources of migration data can be broadly grouped into three categories – statistical, administrative and innovative – see Figure for an overview of these. Each of these has distinct advantages and disadvantages. Regarding statistical data sources, for example, censuses are universal and often comparable across countries. On the other hand, they are costly and as many countries conduct censuses only every years and often at different points in time, data can easily be outdated and hard to compare globally. Also, they do not always capture certain populations of interest such as asylum seekers, refugees and irregular migrants. Surveys can be more targeted to migrants and can also yield valuable migration information on socioeconomic characteristics of migrants and can be relatively timely. However, their sample size and coverage can be limited. Administrative data source generally are not set up specifically to collect data on migrants, but can often yield some relevant informat"

Recent survey research undertaken by the Regional Mixed Migration Secretariat in Ethiopia found that despite a very high proportion of potential migrants being aware of the risks associated with irregular travel to Yemen and Saudi Arabia, per cent indicated that the benefits of migration were worth the risks faced during the journey and upon arrival in transit and destination countries. Tolerance of different types of abuse andor physical hardship during migration was found to have ranged from between per cent sexual abuse to per cent degrading treatment and verbal abuse.

"OAuth may not be the ultimate solution, but it is the one being used despite some issues. The first is security. OAuth makes use of a framework called Transport Layer Security TLS. This is a widelyused set of protocols used to secure email, web browsing etc. The problem is that there is no authoritative implementation of the protocols. There are commercial as well as open source versions. Some of these have suffered security breaches because the protocol was not implemented properly. Today there does not exist a provably secure version of TLS although there is active ongoing work by Amazon, Microsoft and others in creating one. The second issue is phishing. It would not be hard to create fake requests for OAuth tokens that look authentic. It may be necessary to have a secondary verification such as confirmation on one’s cell phone to verify that a request is valid. A greater challenge lies in the concept of implementing privacy bundles. Typical EHRs are paged documents. It is not easy "

However, adolescent girls do not always have access to these forms of care or information about the importance of these services, especially when they are married at an early age and have become socially isolated within their husbands’ households.

For example, we don’t intuitively think of visual perception or walking as particularly ‘intelligent’ tasks, because they are things we do with little conscious effort but attempting to replicate these abilities in machines has shown they actually rely on incredibly complex processes.We alsoFor example, the terms ‘transparency’,‘explainability’, ‘interpretability’, and ‘intelligibility’ are often used interchangeably to refer to what ‘blackbox"
"Of these laws, the FTC enforces ECOA, which prohibits credit discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or because a person receives public assistance. To prove a violation of ECOA, plaintiffs typically must show “disparate treatment” or “disparate impact.” Disparate treatment occurs when a creditor treats an applicant differently based on a protected characteristic. For example, a lender cannot refuse to lend to single persons or offer less favorable terms to them than married persons even if big data analytics show that single persons are less likely to repay loans than married persons. Disparate impact occurs when a company employs facially neutral policies or practices that have a disproportionate adverse effect or impact on a protected class, unless those practices or policies further a legitimate business need that cannot reasonably be achieved by means that are less disparate in their impact.

The amount of premium exceeds the cost of compliance and could easily amount to multimillioneuro penalties.

"One global institutional investor believes the industry is complacent about the robustness of socalled fortress malls or highquality retail locations simply because retail is changing from a lowtech to a hightech endeavour, and from a transactional to a leisure focus. “What that means for investors at the high end is that it is very easy to overstate rental growth. There will be more power in the retailer going forward than the mall operator, particularly given the oversupply in the US,” he says. “Customers’ footfall will be harder to capture in individual malls. Operators are not going to be able to push rents so much and they are going to have to pay more on the capex side. So, underwriting errors on both of these could be quite substantial and expensive. There is a grave danger as that unwinds investors like us could overpay for the better locations.

"One type of case that enforcers could pursue under existing frameworks would involve alleging that platform companies’ conduct with respect to their datasets amounts to an impermissible “refusal to supply.” In general, as the Federal Trade Commission notes, “a seller has the right to choose its business partners.” In other words, firms can sell to whomever they like, provided that “the refusal is not the product of an anticompetitive agreement with other firms or part of a predatory or exclusionary strategy to acquire or maintain a monopoly.” While it would admittedly be difficult to argue that a given technology firm’s refusal to share its data with consumers, its content providers or its advertisers was part of such a strategy, there is U.S. Supreme Court precedent for treating data as an input to final products or services.

Apple removed this feature in the new iPhone, and it now encrypts the internal contents of the phone in a way that is not easily defeated, and for which Apple does not hold the keys and thus cannot enable access.

First, to simulate the scenario with very high peak arriving rate and very low peak arriving rate, we run two sets of experiments by generating the arriving rate based on the maximum throughput ru and minimum throughput rl respectively. Specifcally, the maximum throughput is the sum of all models’ largest throughput, which is achieved when all models run asyn­chronously to process different batches of requests. In contrast, when all models run synchronously, the slowest model’s minimum throughput is just the overall minimum throughput. Second, we use a sine function to defne the request arriving rate, i.e., r .sint b.

"Over the last five years, there have been many projections of the numbers of jobs likely to be lost, gained, or changed by AI technologies, with varying outcomes and using various timescales for analysis. Most recently, a consensus has begun to emerge from such studies that – of jobs in the UK are highly automatable. Many new jobs will also be created. The rapid increase in the use of administrative data and more detailed informa­tion on tasks has helped improve the reliability of empirical analysis. This has reduced the reliance on untested theoretical models and there is a growing consensus about the main types of jobs that will suffer and where the growth in new jobs will appear. However, there remain large uncertainties about the likely new technologies and their precise relationship to tasks. Consequently, it is difficult to make precise predictions as to which jobs will see a fall in demand and the scale of new job creation.The Frontier Economics literature review, published alon"
"Over the past few years, sev­eral algorithms used to automate adversarialsample generation have emerged for multiclass classifiers built, for example, with deep neural networks. In late , Christian Szegedy and his colleagues were the first to reveal the vulnerability of trained deep neural networks to slight perturbations of their inputs when they cast sample generation as an approximate optimization. Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues followed with a fast gradient sign method, which linearly approxi­mates the cost function in the neigh­borhood of legitimate samples to allow faster crafting of adversarial samples. Finally, Nicolas Papernot and his colleagues proposed an iterative crafting algorithm that uses the model’s Jacobian to select perturbations yielding the adver­sary’s desired classification. They showed that adversaries can reli­ably achieve chosen adversarial tar­get classes for any legitimate source class. Their iterative approach also allows greater control over the introdu"

"OVERVIEW OF THIS SECTIONThis section discusses the following concluding observations and policy implicationsThe way policymakers analyse manufacturing needs to be updated to reflect the increasing complexity of modern industries New sources of data and analytical approaches are required to better understand challenges and opportunities in advanced manufacturing and the potential role of policies to support it. One promising approach is to redefine sectors as value networks.Interpreting manufacturing as a cross cutting theme can help reveal the linkages between science, technology and innovation STI policies, and industrial strategies Analysing manufacturing themes across industries and technologies can provide policy insights that cannot be fully revealed by analysing individual technologies or sectors, such as the potential to generate productive employment from science and research investments, mechanisms to support technology diffusion among SMEs and sustainability tradeoffs.

"Oxford Economics compiled survey data on the age and income of international travelers from a sample of countries in and , and calculated international travel frequencies and share of travel by age bracket and income class for each country. Changes in travel share by age bracket and income class were then interpolated over the ten year historical period for the sample countries and projected to a broader set of countries based on their classification as developed or emerging markets and key variables such as GDP per capita and total international arrivals per capita. The estimated travel shares were compared with each country’s household income distribution and age distribution to develop a historical relationship from which to forecast. Oxford Economics forecasts of each country’s distribution of household income and age were leveraged against outbound arrivals forecasts to project international travel shares and volumes by income class and age bracket from to.

"Passage of tax reform legislation in late appears to have invigorated market participants across many sectors of the economy. While the full effect of the new legislation will likely play out over the course of the rest of the year and beyond, the implications for valuation multiples are generally expected to be positive. The effective tax rates for many multinational medical device companies were already below the new corporate rate. Accordingly, reductions in overall tax burdens for device companies are likely modest. A more immediate effect materialized in the form of a transition tax on corporate cash parked outside the U.S. for example, Johnson and Johnson reported a onetime. billion charge related to the new tax law. With a lower tax rate available on deemed repatriation, many corporations will likely have a more direct access to hithertounused overseas funds.Copyright © Mercer Capital Management, Inc.

"Patents are intellectual property rights. Patents are territorial, meaning that they provide protection only in the jurisdiction where an application was filed and a patent is granted. Patents are thus generally granted by national patent offices – or through regional systems, such as the European Patent Convention EPC administered by the European Patent Office EPO. In many jurisdictions, the patent office examines each application to see whether it meets certain requirements, including that the invention must fall under a patentable subject matter in the jurisdictions in question e.g., discoveries, scientific theories, mathematical methods and computer programs per se are in general not patentable, whereas software is patentable in some jurisdictions, be novel i.e., not be part of the state of the art, involve an inventive step i.e., be “nonobvious”, have a potential industrial application, and the claimed invention be sufficiently disclosed.

"Patient experience — Staff members, who work daily with patients on the front line, play a significant role in identifying new or enhanced involvement by the pharmacy in health and wellness concerns. Case in point A delivery driver who actually knocks on the patient’s door as opposed to leaving a medication package on the front porch—the concept of handdelivery versus home delivery—may find out about an underlying health issue that can be relayed back to pharmacy management. “Proper training not only helps staff understand how to look for opportunities in the patient population, but as important, understand the value of their role within the pharmacy,” says Zilka.

"Personalised design and production is one of the mostpromising retail applications for nextgeneration technology. Instead of being produced uniformly, apparels and consumables can be tailored on demand. Take fashion and clothing, for example. The industry could eventually move to fully interactive and customised design and supply in which AIcreated mockups of garments are sold online, made in small batches using automated production, and subsequent changes are made to design based on user feedback. Oregonbased textile innovation company Unspun, for example, uses D image processing and ARVR to develop bespoke dresses, and then emails the designs to customers for approval. Another example of smallbatch, fasttomarket production of running shoes is the Adidas Speedfactory, which has produced runs of pairs of a certain design.

"PLM is known for its “single source of truth” view of product information as a result of the trust accorded to a centralized administration team. The challenge within an enterprise with various business functions collaborating to develop a product is that each business function ends up having its own version of truth, too. At many organizations, trust among business functions becomes the prime driver for creating the single source of truth. But in reality, multiple vendors and suppliers also participate in the product development cycle, and hence trust is shared with them, too. As a result, product development is enabled through the “shared trust” among multiple stakeholders, both internal and external to an organization.Fresh thinking is required to address multiple challenges to satisfy the growing demand on product information, to reduce dependency on IT departments, to reduce the management effort applied to customization, and to raise operational agility and flexibility.

"Policymakers also will need to address new potential barriers stemming from any algorithmic bias. Firms are beginning to use consumer data, including data sets collected by “thirdparty” data services companies, to determine individuals’ fitness for credit, insurance and even employment. Other firms are pioneering the use of games, simulations, and electronic tests to determine the “fit” of job applicants to a team. To do this, automated algorithms may be trained with data about successful team members in order to look for applicants that resemble them. One important benefit of these innovations is enabling companies to recruit and hire candidates based on demonstrated skills and abilities rather than pedigree, which will become even more critical as people gain skills on the job. But if such training sets are based on a less diverse current workforce, the biases of the existing group may be built into the resulting decisions and may unfairly exclude new potential talent.

"Previous studies comparing these two indexes as predictors of life evaluations have found that quality of delivery is more important than the democracy variable, both in studies across countries and in ones that include countryfixed effects, so that the estimated effects are based on changes in governance quality within each country. These latter results are more convincing, since they are uninfluenced by crosscountry differences in other variables, and have the capacity to show whether significant changes in the quality of government can happen within a policyrelevant time horizon. These studies made use of data from the World Values Survey and from the Gallup World Poll, but were based on shorter sample periods.

"Pride, selfconfidence and selfefficacy were cultivated as parents realized that they could provide their children with a sense of worth. Selfefficacy, the selfperception of the ability to achieve one’s goal, plays a key role in assisting adults to realize their goals Bandura,. Logs and interviews indicated that providing support to one’s community e.g., helping others, making the community a better place to live helped demonstrate to participants that they had something of value to give to others. For example, a participant from the East Side House program in the Bronx reported that her daughter learned that her family, although poor, had something of value to give to other families in the community. This offered both the child and the mother a sense of importance and relevance to their community. Participants also grew more confident in their knowledge and ability to take on and complete projects that required language, literacy, technology, and community interactions—key skills that "

The main outcome of the meeting was that academics, NGOs and the UN UNODC in particular must work together as partners, not marginalize each other. The focus was on the need to share evidencebased high quality data achieved through capacity building on a national level which requires greater collaboration among stakeholders. Among participants were academics already doing research in the field.

"Protecting AI innovation is a challenge. Software architectures and algorithms have become harder to patent as a re­sult of recent changes in the law, most notably the Supreme Court’s Alice decision. In patent prosecution, as many AI systems focus on source code and algorithms and replicating human activity, the challenge is how to claim it to be patent eligible. However, the USPTO has recognised that AI can be patentable by an express class designa­tion, and at least two examining prior art units are specifically designated for reviewing patent applications directed toward AI algorithms. Companies may find more success by focusing on AI hardware innovations. A trade secret protection strategy is also wellsuited for the rapidly developing and chang­ing marketplace of AI innovations.

"Reducing the time to insight from months to days speeds up the process of getting value out of a model, which can result in competitive advantage. To eliminate bottlenecks in faster model iteration and value realization, organizations need an AI data pipeline — a set of data processing elements connected in a series, where the output of one element is the input of the next element. Such a pipeline supports smooth data flow from data ingestion to transformation, from exploration to training to inferencing, and then into longterm archival storage for future use.

"RQ User study. We designed a questionnaire about a machine that learns a simple concept by querying labels but not explanation corrections to an annotator. The ques­tionnaire, available in the Supplementary Material, was ad­ministered to randomly selected undergraduate students from an introductory course on deep learning. We designed a toy binary classifcation problem inspired by Ross and oth­ers about classifying small blackandwhite images. The subjects were told that an image is positive if the two top corners are white and negative otherwise. Then they were shown three learning sessions consisting of fve queryfeedback rounds each. In session S every round included the images chosen by the model, the correspond­ing prediction, and the label provided by a knowledgeable annotator. No explanations were shown.

"Runtime is the environment where training or prediction could occur local, e.g. on endpoint, or remote, e.g. in cloud. The runtime for each ML step informs how quickly a model can be updated with new samples, the impacts of decision making, and dependence on resources such as CPU, memory, and IO. For supervised models, note that labels must be available during training, so training can only occur where labels are available. In practice, training is typically done in a cluster of distributed servers in the cloud. Prediction is more common in the cloud as well, but increasingly performed locally. Distributed training on local user or customer devices is an emerging technology. Although there are major possible benefits, including reduced IO and protection of sensitive data, there are many challenges such as heterogeneous resources, unreliable availability, and slower experimental iterations.These factors enable us to separate cybersecurity technologies into five distinct generations of M"

US Census Bureau projections show the workingage population likely to shrink dramatically by. Russia’s present trajectory away from pluralism toward bureaucratic authoritarianism also decreases the chances it will be able to attract foreign investment outside the energy sector, limiting prospects for diversifying its economy.

"SAGARPA has recognized USDA for their support and assistance in the Binational Program for the Eradication of Pink Bollworm and Boll Weevil. Control actions were taken to successfully eradicate these pests by using integrated pest management, genetic engineered seeds and applying the sterile insect and pheromone mating disruption techniques. Both techniques used biological material provided by USDA. Bt genetic engineered cotton directed against the pink bollworm has been used in Mexico since.

"School safety and security remains a significant concern across the nation as well as in Connecticut. Since the Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy, the legislature has taken steps to help school districts improve school safety. PA required each district to craft a school security plan and submit it to the state. It also required that new school construction projects meet improved security standards in order to receive state grants and created a competitive grant program to reimburse school districts for security improvements at existing schools. Last year, PA authorized an additional million in bonds for the competitive grant program. This year the legislature may consider making changes to the security standards or the school security grant program, including whether to authorize more funding.The legislative and executive branches have taken various steps in recent years to address the underfunding of the state’s two largest pension systems, the State Employee Retirement System SERS"
"Scots led the way in the Enlightenment, not only with Adam Smith’s idea in his Wealth of Nations of an open, free trade world that breaks free from mercantilism, but with his even more powerful idea in his Theory of Moral Sentiments of a world linked together by empathy his idea that we were able to put ourselves in other peoples’ shoes – what was called ‘the circle of empathy’ – led people to feel beyond their immediate family circle, however distantly and faintly, feel the pain of others. This underpinned the Scots’ achievement in partnering England and Wales in the world’s first industrial revolution. Scotland not only produced some of the world’s greatest inventors, starting with James Watt and his invention of the steam engine, but it also produced some of the world’s great reformers. For Scots led the way in civilizing the industrial economy by demanding and planning the creation of the British welfare state.

"Selfconsistency D can be more challenging than it might first appear. The large number of landings in multi­ple environments means that some results might be seem­ingly contradictory equivalently, based on the available data the landing classes may not be separable. For exam­ple, a really smooth landing in wet conditions may lead to input signals similar to InAir e.g. laser altimeter might read high altitude due to spurious reflections and accel­erometers read low VertAcc and HorzAcc but with a label of Landing. If that is the case, the underlying features of the contradictions may need to be explored and the sys­tem may need to be redesigned e.g. to provide additional sensor inputs to introduce new variables for greater ro­bustness. Fortunately, statistical analysis of the data may help. Data that is distributionally dissimilar but has the same classification may be inconsistent. In many ways this can be seen as the inverse problem to detecting adversarial examples, where the distribu"

"Several trends are apparent when examining how these laws typically fare in the legislative process. First, vociferous campaigns opposing the measures led by civil society organizations CSOs and activists are contributing to their defeat. In Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Minnesota, and Virginia, among others, highprofile advocacy campaigns led by CSOs have successfully convinced lawmakers that laws restricting protest activities threaten longstanding and deeply cherished constitutional protections. For example, in Colorado, a bill seeking to bar teachers from participating in strikes was subject to widespread criticism by advocacy groups in the days immediately following its introduction. Subsequently, a Senate committee voted to postpone the bill indefinitely and its sponsors agreed to withdraw it. Similarly in Arizona a law that would have substantially expanded the definition of “riot” failed to achieve the necessary votes in the House of Representatives after the house speaker and th"
"Severance Similar to the U.S., most countries discourage high severance payouts with or without change in control e.g., twice salary plus bonus. Most, owing to proxy advisor pressures, have adopted best practices that generally do not favor payouts in excess of twice salary plus bonus. South Africa is especially strict, imposing onerous tax penalties for excessive severance. More typical is France, where severance packages must not exceed two years’ cash pay and must be performancebased. Australia limits severance pay to no more than one year’s pay Clawbacks Only a few countries, including the U.S., Belgium, and Ireland, require recoupment in the event of financial restatements. As a result of proxy advisor pressures, most countries generally follow best practices that call for a minimum clawback in the event of fraud or misconduct.

"Sharing and repurposing educational materials is not new. What is new however, is the developments in technology which have made it easier to collaborate, share and disseminate content. It was back in , well before the word OER was coined, that COL initiated STAMP. COL brought together course writers from countries to develop modules of teacher training materials. The main objective was to build the capacity of teachers and then share the resulting content. Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s MIT Open Courseware OCW initiative took a leadership role in which teachers placed their lecture notes online for free use, which also resulted in more applicants to the university. The Open University UK’s Open Learn followed by placing existing selfinstructional materials, in online format. This was another step that the OUUK took in opening up education. Even though the objectives of the organisations differed, the common strategy was to share free content.The cost of textbooks even impacts"

Both NMI and CMItype efforts will include selecting commercial and academic partners for prototypes and employing standardized processes with respect to areas such as data, testing and evaluation, and cybersecurity. The JAIC will use lessons learned from these initial pilots to establish new processes and systems that will be repeatable across additional projects. Given the rapidly changing nature of adversaries and situations, and the rapid pace of change in enabling technologies, JAIC execution will prioritize dissolving the traditional sharp division between research and operations. The insertion of new technologies into complex work systems changes the nature of the work, including new forms of brittleness and error, and uncovers new challenges at the same time that it improves the work in other respects.

"Siblings can also have conflicting interests, and migration is probably the most contentious issue. On the one hand, in the runup to the European elections, the EU is willing to put forward a coherent migration control policy – the leading concern of EU citizens. On the other hand, African countries, in particular those for which migration is an opportunity, are wary of the growing impact of EU migration policy on development cooperation. However, since the Valletta Summit in , a shared approach to addressing the root causes of migration is emerging. EU and African leaders share the opinion that fostering an environment conducive to business development is a key feature to create jobs at a pace proportionate to Africas fast demographic growth although to what extent this would reduce or increase migration to the EU is a debatable topic.

"Some experts also warn of future scenarios in which the projected changes are even more drastic. For ex­ample, the economist Robin Hanson expects that it will be possible within this century to digitally run hu­man brain simulations—socalled whole brain emulations WBEs —in virtual reality. WBEs would be repro­ducible, and could assuming that su.icient hardware is available run many times faster than a biological brain, consequently implying a huge increase in labor e.iciency. Hanson predicts that in such a case, there would be a “population explosion” amongst WBEs, who could be used as enormously coste.icient workers. Han­son’s speculations are contested , and it should not be assumed that they sketch out the most likely future sce­nario.

"Some job guarantee proposals would pay tiered wages, with higher wages for workers of higher skill. We see two problems with such a strategy. First, it could generate the same political fighting that we saw over the New Deal programs. States dominated by conservatives will try to exclude projects with higher wages. More importantly, higher wages for workers with greater skills will increase competition with private sector employers. Indeed, during periods of economic growth, there is already substantial competition for skilled workers. We believe that the most serious unemployment problem faced in the United States is chronic unemployment for workers with lower skills and education—they have high unemployment and underemployment through thick and thin of the business cycle. Our design targets job creation to this group. While workers with greater education and skills will turn to this program when jobs are scarce, PSE participation for them will be transitional they will work temporari"
"Some models are developed for use in database marketing to score customers. For example, a marketer needs to know which customers are most likely to purchase a product to target special offers at those customers. Marketing efforts can also have a rather small event rate, commonly called response rate – often in the range of percent. Thompson says, “If I’m evaluating models that I use in database marketing, I’d use statis­tics that look at lift or how well the model performs at a particular depth of file. I may not be interested in the overall misclassification rate for my model. I only have percent responders, so the null model is percent accurate. Here, I like to first develop predic­tions, generate a prediction profile with regard to a lift and select models that maximize lift at depth of file.”Scale means a variety of things to different people within an organization.

"Some of our witnesses told us of the specific areas within healthcare that could benefit from artificial intelligence. The Royal College of Radiologists told us “medical imaging is perfectly placed to benefit from advances in AI” because of the availability of high quality, curated data, “overcoming one of the main hurdles in AI development”. At Microsoft Research in Cambridge, we saw their work on ‘InnerEye’ technology, which is being developed to assist oncologists in the analysis of xray and MRI scans. Such an application has the potential to dramatically reduce the cost of analysing scans, allowing far more to be taken over the course of a treatment, thereby facilitating more accurately targeted treatment.

"Sponsortosponsor deals and IPOs. Sponsortosponsor deals remained an important exit channel globally. While off slightly in terms of value, sponsortosponsor exits turned in their thirdstrongest year ever for the industry in. The value of IPOs, meanwhile, fell globally as market uncertainty and higher volatility curtailed activity, especially in Europe and AsiaPacific. As GPs grapple with an uncertain economic outlook, IPOs can be less attractive than onetime sales. Public offerings are essen­tially slowmotion exits, since mandated holding periods and market timing considerations force a firm to hold onto a large share of its investment for a period of years. That can allow a GP to continue to prof­it from the upside in good times, but if the economy falters, so might the value of the investment.

"Stage Validating for accuracy At this stage, the predic­tive system is used to generate predictions on data for which one knows the ground truth. It allows the deployment team to measure whether the model can produce accurate predic­tions on data not provided to the training phase. To do this, we used the data from February to September and the roll back and test process we described above. We selected multiple cutofftimes during the period, made predictions, and compared these predictions against the actual outcomes. This validation reveals any unknown biases and mismatchesinconsistencies in the data, inconsistencies in the understanding of what data should be given to the model and even data drifting. Ultimately, it establishes the trust and confdence in the predictive sys­tem that deployment teams require in order to take it live.

While political commitments to protect media freedom, including those adopted in the OSCE framework, are imperative, they are only effective when backed up by strong political will, as well as by solid policies and practices to bolster the safety of media, and to establish comprehensive cooperation between States, international institutions and nongovernmental organisations.In far too many cases investigations into violence or threats of violence against journalists and media outlets are slow, incom"
"Staying at Ett Hem is like being a guest in somebody’s private home. Each morning the chefs decide on the day’s menu which both guests and nonresidents can enjoy at a time and a place of their choice – in the Greenhouse, in the library or in the kitchen. Guests can also help themselves to a snack or a drink in the kitchen any time they like. Foxhill Manor in the UK also follows this premise. All guests are introduced to the chef at the beginning of their stay. Based on the local ingredients available, they can provide the chef with exact details on how they want their meal to be cooked even down to how they want their vegetables sliced and enjoy it anywhere from the bath to the cinema room. Visitors can also serve themselves drinks at the beverage station and access the cellar to select their own wine.Scent has the power to trigger memories in a far more powerful way than any other sense, so it only seems natural that hotels would want to use this to enhance a guest’s experience.

"Streaming sparse projection Bonsai projects each Ddimensional input feature vector x into a low Dˆ ­dimensional space using a learnt sparse projection matrix ZDˆD. Bonsai uses fxed point arithmetic for all math computation, including Zx, when implemented on the IoT device so as to avoid foating point overheads. Note that Dˆ could be as low as for many binary classifcation applica­tions. This has the following advantages. First, it reduces Bonsai’s model size as all tree parameters are now learnt in the lowdimensional space. Second, when Dˆ is small, Zx could be stored directly in the microcontroller’s regis­ters thereby reducing prediction time and energy. Third, learning the projection matrix jointly with the tree param­eters improves prediction accuracy. Fourth, since Zx can be computed in a streaming fashion, this allows Bonsai to tackle IoT applications where even a single feature vector cannot ft in KB of SRAM. This is critical since stan­dard tree implementations are unable to ha"

The rapid growth in consumption of iron ore is driven by demand from the Chinese steel industry. Rapid economic develop­ment, which has resulted in the achievement of middle class living standards for millions of Chinese citizens, underlies this growth. Such growth leads to some staggering observations. For example, the production of raw steel in China since the year is roughly equal to the total produced in the U.S. in the entire th century, which amounts to approximately billion metric tons. Other equally spectacular statistics can be cited. Since , China has produced more cement than the U.S. did in the entire th century. The cement industry in China is now a billion ton per year behemoth. These two examples illustrate the broader trends occurring "

He surveyed more than five hundred monks, including seventyfive who had taken part in redshirt demonstrations he also conducted indepth interviews with fif­teen prominent monks and a number of scholars of Thai Buddhism. He found that sangha council prohibitions on taking part in political activities were widely disregarded.

"Taken together, the very strong jobs growth and increasingly rising wages suggest labour income growth is solid and should be supportive of consumption going forward. An early indication of this could be the pickup in auto sales observed so far this year chart. We expect to see consumption pick up later in and into. The effect of tightened housing rules and the hangover from past rounds of fiscal stimulus delivered via the Canada Child Benefit should be maturing so that solid wage and income gains, and very strong recent job growth, should begin to drive our projection of an improving consumption outlook into. Consumption spending should also find support from a recent turnaround in household credit growth, which appears to have found its bottom in mid.

"The Aegon Retirement Readiness Survey finds that percent of workers in Australia are in physical roles. Traditionally, Australia’s economy has long prospered from its agriculture, mining and manufacturing sectors. However, its services economy in accounted for about percent of GDP, with percent of Australians employed in this sector. The remaining percent is split among manufacturing, agriculture and mining. The types of physical skills in demand in Australia have shifted over the past few decades. Automation introduced in the s and s caused the number of routine manual roles to drop from about percent of overall employment in to percent in. Over the same timeframe, nonroutine manual labor has risen from about percent to percent. The survey finding that percent of physical workers have an undergraduate degree or higher broadly comparable to the percent of nonphysical workers with a degree demonstrates the changing nature of physical worker roles in Australia.Physical workers generally "

"The Arab Uprising further intensified the struggle for power inside and among states, thereby unleashing the sectarian demon. To be sure, few of the protestors that launched the uprisings instrumentalized sectarianism rather, the discourse of the youthful middle class protestors who dominated the early period of the uprisings stressed nonviolence and crosssectarian appeal – in a bid to neutralize regimes’ sectarian divideandrule tactics and also to get Western support by advertising their liberal credentials. In sectarian divided states like Syria, there were plenty of covert sectarian grievances operative and the protestors demand for equal citizenship conveyed resentment of what was perceived as the regime’s sectarian discrimination. Still, the uprisings were everywhere chiefly driven by socioeconomic and political grievances notably associated by the move to postpopulism and the frustration of expectations that economic liberalization would be paralleled by political opening.

"The automation of driving i.e. socalled autonomous driving will initially increase primarily in narrowly defined and geographically restricted areas – most likely mainly in inner cities and on highways. This is also due to the fact that the dimensions autonomous and electrified are mutually supportive. For example, autonomous vehicles create a clear case for electrical drive since the “inner city” use case is aimed at just this scenario. One example of this is an automatic charging process that uses inductive charging. The reciprocal effect of these two dimensions results in a positive overall effect. It therefore seems possible that by there will only be a small, singledigit percentage of pure combustion engines among new car sales in the EU. In this scenario, more than of new cars will already be fully electrified. Forty percent of new vehicles would still include hybrid drive technologies in combination with combustion engines.Our mobility behaviour will change radically. As soon as"

"The BEPS recommendations also include tighter restrictions on how companies can levy charges for IP, brands and related intangibles than those previously used in many IP models. As a result, companies need to do more to demonstrate true substance behind the development, enhancement, management, protection and enhancement DEMPE functions focused on in relation to such intangibles to justify the level of charging across borders. Absent sufficient substance, companies will need to make appropriate, meaningful changes to either their operations staffing, expertise, facilities in support of IP or to their intangiblesbased transfer pricing — or be prepared to reduce such pricing. One thing that is certain is that the new landscape “will require companies to ensure that they can demonstrate a close alignment of legal ownership with the management of intangibles, especially where intangiblesbased income arises in lower tax jurisdictions,” says Cornelius Grossmann, EY Law Leader.For example, th"

"The central goal of an RL application is to learn a policy—a mapping from the state of the environment to a choice of action—that yields effective performance over time, e.g., winning a game or piloting a drone. Finding ef­fective policies in largescale applications requires three main capabilities. First, RL methods often rely on simula­tion to evaluate policies. Simulations make it possible to explore many different choices of action sequences and to learn about the longterm consequences of those choices. Second, like their supervised learning counterparts, RL al­gorithms need to perform distributed training to improve the policy based on data generated through simulations or interactions with the physical environment. Third, poli­cies are intended to provide solutions to control problems, and thus it is necessary to serve the policy in interactive closedloop and openloop control scenarios.The promise of AI is, however, far broader than classi­cal supervised learning.

"The challenge posed by China and Russia notwithstanding, it could be argued that the United States’ position in the world – and with it the global order the US has shaped – “may be threatened more by the rise of populist politics at home than the rise of other powers abroad.” In material terms, the United States remains in a league of its own. Its defense budget still dwarfs the military spending of most other powers. Moreover, standard measures, such as gross domestic product or military spending, distort the real balance of power by systematically exaggerating the wealth and military capabilities of populous but poor countries that have to spend a lot of their resources on policing, protecting, and serving their people and thus have less capacity for power projection abroad. While China and Russia may have made progress and even excel at some key capabilities, the US military will remain second to none for a long time. Most importantly, however, the United States can rely on resource"

"The consequences of the Asian economic boom that has been closely associated with a paradigm shift from a postindustrial to a new technological era have led to the emergence and fast expansion of an affluent middleclass in countries across the region – new segments of the population with sufficient disposable incomes to travel. This has also been accompanied by a sociocultural shift in the number of holidays available to the general public in Asia in the last two decades where many countries in the region have liberalized the duration of “paid vacations” thereby increasing the leisure time of employees which has greatly benefitted tourism. All these forces have led to a new sector with its own characteristics, the consumerclass, propelled by another rising group, the technology savvy millennials, that has emerged recently, changing the face of Asian tourism.Centre for Aviation CAPA Global Airport Construction Review for Q indicated that there were around airport construction projects i"

"The Convention also stipulated that serious offences such as the production, manufacture, trans­port, sale, importation, exportation of drugs would be extraditable, ending years of impunity and curtailing the ability of crime bosses to continue their operations from behind the walls of local pris­ons. In the Americas, this may have prompted organized crime groups to adjust their strategies. Rather than sending drugs straight to lucrative final destinations where extradition treaties were enforced, they may have begun to make use of transit coun­tries from where extradition was less likely, even if prices were lower and profits were smaller. This changed international drug trafficking flows as well as the power structures of organized crime groups. Colombian groups, for example, may have given up influence, enabling Mexican organized crime groups to fill the void and develop into powerful drug car­tels. The change also may have created new opportunities for smaller groups to get involve"

Although there is a clear definition for market design, the matter appears as a high uncertainty in the issues map, because in , the Polish energy sector is expected to face a lot of challenges and strategic decisions. Russia appears as an uncertainty because it refers to the still unresolved Ukrainian conflict and the risk in ensuring security of gas supply to Poland. Another uncertain issued related to Russia is the Nord Stream project which is perceived as unfavourable to the Polish and the EU diversification and security of gas supply. Commodity prices are will continue to stay on the top of the agenda due to volatility and unpredictability of global markets e.g. oil, gas, coal.

"The evidence in this area shows that young people from a relatively lower socioeconomic position tend to be less physically active, report less healthful food choices, and are more likely to be overweight or obese ,. A study in Norway, for example, found adolescents from a lower socioeconomic position consumed relatively less fruit and vegetables and more soft drinks and fast food. Adolescents from a lower socioeconomic position in Slovakia were less likely to be physically active five or more times per week , and a study in France found that children born to highly educated mothers possessing a diploma higher than baccalaureate were. less likely to be overweight than those whose mothers had less education.

"The experience of ASEAN Member States with economic zones in attracting investment has been encouraging for various reasons. They facilitate quick setup of operations for foreign investors, lower the transaction costs of investing and operating in the host country, ensure factories are more secure, induce agglomeration of firms and generate cluster benefits. To the extent that economic zones are able to reduce transaction costs, they increase their attractiveness to potential economic zone tenants. The need to provide good services in and to economic zones is important. The key issue is how to make them more effective in attracting FDI and in achieving the economic objectives of the host country. Not all economic zones are successful. Some are more successful than others at attracting investments and developing clusters. Some zones have not been successful in attracting investment because of their lack of competitiveness and lack of good facilities. Some are located far from major road"
"The fact is that we do not really understand what intelligence is or where it comes from. This goes for not only the artificial kind, but also our innate intelligence. One reason for this problem is the many different definitions of intelligence. However, there have been some developments lately. Science has throughout the last decades increasingly adopted the view of intelligence as an emergent property of some complex systems. That means that the aggregate behavior of very simple parts of certain complex systems lead to intelligent behavior. The part of you or the people you know that is responsible for what can be called intelligent behavior is in reality a finely tuned network of very simple parts. This view of intelligence as the behavior of simple parts in a complex system has some interesting consequences, because it has led to scientists finding what fits this definition of intelligence in surprising places. For example, a single termite is not especially smart. One might even "
"The Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment is changing. Women empowerment, globalization, European integration, the emergence of economies in the Global South, and many other cultural and economic trends mean that our faculty is more diverse than ever. In many ways, we are at the forefront of diversity. But in some areas, we lag be­hind. Diversity is a big opportunity, but it also comes with a few challenges. It means we need to learn how to work, teach and interact with people who are very different from us. Cultural and other differences mean that we have a valuable multiplicity of worldviews, but it also means that people are sensitive to differ­ent things. TU Delft is taking diversity seriously and has a plan. We want to hear from you about what the challenges and oppor­tunities are and find out how we can make our faculty even more inclusive and welcoming to you.

To receive FDA approval, clinical trials on medical marijuana would need to be conducted to determine its safety and effectiveness. Without FDA approval, the purity and potency of medical marijuana may vary considerably.

"The following scenario, in which data pro­tection regulations are emerging, presents a new challenge How can the new stan­dards that emerge in each region or coun­try work alongside those of other coun­tries, considering that the very nature of the internet involves a lack of regard for geographic borders? It also raises other questions, such as what will happen when two rules conflict with each other or when there are gaps in legislation failing to ad­dress unanticipated scenarios. There is a need to establish rules, but also a system that keeps track of new requirements as they emerge and anticipates evolutionary advances so the rules can be updated over time.

"The GDPR provides relatively little clarification as to how it defines “meaningful information,” which could lead to legal battles over the extent of the right. The articles themselves do not specify whether “meaningful information about the logic involved” refers to an explanation of how a particular algorithm generally reached decisions, or to a precise explanation of exactly how the algorithm arrived at a particular conclusion. Recital seems to imply the latter when it says the data subject should be able to “obtain an explanation of the decision,” but it does not specify what information would constitute an explanation or whether information about the “logic involved” should pertain to the algorithm or to the decision. Were a regulator or court to interpret the law to mean data controllers must be able to explain precisely how each individual decision was reached, it would severely inhibit AI because there is a tradeoff between an algorithm’s sophistication and its explicability—ar"

"The global economy is currently at a turning point. Until early , there had been a confluence of positive events including relatively strong global economic growth, low inflation, low borrowing costs, easy monetary policy in major markets, recovery in troubled emerging markets, and rising asset prices. Yet something changed in. Growth decelerated in Europe, China, and Japan inflation accelerated in major markets borrowing costs increased as major governments embarked on a shift in monetary and fiscal policies global equity and commodity prices fell and major emerging markets experienced significant currency depreciation. The shift in the global economy was, in part, brought on by a change in policy in the United States US. There, a combination of easier fiscal policy, tighter monetary policy, and restrictive trade policy contributed to a change in the direction of the global economy. For retailers, this change will mean slower consumer spending growth, higher consumer prices, and disru"

"The GPI is a composite index of indicators weighted and combined into one overall score. The weighting scheme within any composite index represents the relative importance of each indicator to the overall aim of the measure, in the GPI’s case, global peace. To fully understand the representative nature or accuracy of any measure it is necessary to understand how sensitive the results of the index are to the specific weighting scheme used. If the analysis holds true for a large subset of all possible weighting schemes then the results can be called robust. While it is expected that ranks will be sensitive to changes in the weights of any composite index, what is more important in a practical sense is the robustness of country comparisons. One of the core aims of the GPI is to allow for Country A to be compared to Country B. This raises the question that for any two countries, how often is the first ranked more peaceful than the second across the spectrum of weights. The more times that "

"The human population is getting older. Fertility is falling, and the world’s population is graying dramatically. While aging has been evident in developed economies for some time—Japan and Russia have seen their populations decline over the past few years—the demographic deficit is now spreading to China and soon will reach Latin America. For the first time in human history, aging could mean that the planet’s population will plateau in most of the world. Thirty years ago, only a small share of the global population lived in the few countries with fertility rates substantially below those needed to replace each generation—. children per woman. But by , about percent of the world’s population lived in countries with fertility rates below the replacement rate. This is a sea change.

"The increasing importance of deep learningbased ap­plications brings many exciting opportunities yet di­verse and complicated design challenges at the edge. This paper presents the state of the industrial practices for realizing machine learning inference at the edge. We take a datadriven approach by .rst showing the im­portant trends of hardware heterogeneity in the smartphone space and the maturity of the software stack. This leads to important design decisions for deep learn­ing application development at scale. On the other hand, enabling inference for systems such as virtual re­ality platforms, we take a vertical integration approach. By doing so, performance acceleration with coprocessors is far more realistic, leading to faster inference time, lower power consumption, and more importantly re­duced performance variability.

"The interlinkages between banks and nonbank financial entities can take a variety of forms. For example, direct linkages are created when nonbank financial entities form part of the bank credit intermediation chain, are directly owned by banks, or benefit directly from explicit or implicit bank support. This kind of bank support of nonbank financial entities may mask the buildup of excessive leverage or maturityliquidity mismatches in the financial system, by providing “enhancements” to the underlying assets or credit of nonbank financial entities which may make them more acceptable to funding providers. Funding interdependence is another form of direct linkage, as is the holding of each other’s assets, such as debt securities. The risks associated with such interconnectedness can vary depending on the size of the exposure, the credit quality of the counterparty and the funding duration of the credit intermediation. As in previous monitoring exercises, the FSB analysed the interconnect"
"The international community must establish clear benchmarks and criteria, consistent with development effectiveness principles, for the inclusion of private sector resources in public private mechanisms to achieve the SDGs.

"The introduction and uptake of AIenabled CDS software by health care systems will depend upon relevant laws and regulations on medical liability, which vary widely across the United States and around the world. As the realworld integration of AI continues, the scrutiny of liability for harms caused by AI will increase. Existing tort law expects and compensates based on foreseeable, or intended, harm. For DxSS, harm caused by a poor recommendation if implemented is foreseeable. However there is complexity in identifying which entity is responsible for understanding the quality of the recommendation. For example, a DxSS recommendations may be foreseeably problematic by clinicians who understand the medical decision being made. However, forms of AIenabled DxSS which are not interpretable or explainable may leave clinicians with little or no method by which to obtain a modicum of foreseeability over which recommendations are lowquality. Paradoxically, the unforeseeability of AI decisions i"
"The IPCC has already predicted that risks associated with extreme events will continue to increase as the global mean temperature rises.In the field known as Probabilistic Event Attribution PEA, based on climate model experiments, studies compare the probability of an extreme weather situation, in today’s world with humancaused greenhouse gas emissions, to a world without human induced climate change. Due to methodological improvement, “fast track attribution” is now more feasible and can be undertaken within months of the event. However, the link between certain weather events and climate change is still a frontier in science. In general, many studies conclude that “the observed frequency, intensity, and duration of some extreme weather events have been changing as the climate system has warmed”. Nevertheless, it is not easy to investigate the impact of climate change on a single weather event as different regional circumstances need to be taken into account and data might be very lim"

"The market placement strategy was mainly marked by changes in the demand for these securities. For example, the entry into force in October of the US money market fund reform gave rise during to a strong increase in assets managed by funds investing chiefly in shortterm public sector securities, so the US Treasury substantially increased net issuance of Treasury bills at the expense of longerterm issuance. In the case of the United Kingdom, issuance was concentrated in the second quarter of the year, possibly because it was advisable to complete placements before the European Union membership referendum, which was held at the end of that quarter. Finally, against a background of low interest rates and low appetite for risk, issues continue to be increasingly longer term. Thus, as can be seen in Chart ., the average maturity of new issues excluding securities maturing in under months exceeded ten years, except in the United States. In the latter case, statements made by the new US Treas"

"The middle class is aspirational. They don’t want to buy the cheapest product or service, but it has to be affordable. For example, Tata Motors introduced the Tata Nano — billed as the “world’s cheapest car” — to provide India’s in­creasing middle class with an alternative to the more commonly used motor bikes. However, middle class consum­ers said they would prefer to stay at home if their only transportation option was a Nano. The lesson? Don’t focus on being the “cheapest” option when positioning your product to appeal to the middle class, focus more on the aspirational aspects and keep your pricing reasonable.Most companies are currently neglecting the Age population segment. Unless they sell specialized products or services, they are not thinking about how to offer something appealing to the senior market.

The updated ANC register includes reporting on the third and fourth dose of IPTp, and the MiP training of health workers on the revisions is complete. Burkina Faso does not currently have a technical working group or subgroup dedicated to MiP, but strong malaria program leadership and advocacy have contributed significantly to Burkina Faso’s high IPTp coverage.

"The new lithological map of the seabed is very important for the interpretation of global phenomena related to the evolution of ocean basins. An example of this is dia­toms, siliceous phytoplankton that live in the oceans and that through chlorophyll photosynthesis produce about onequarter of the oxygen present in the atmosphere, contributing to reduce global terrestrial warming. At their death, these organisms precipitate through the water column, accumulating on the underlying sea floor. Satellite surveys over the years have identi­fied places where diatomaceous activity is more productive that is, the marine areas in which there are the maximum concentra­tions of chlorophyll, considering that they should also correspond to the areas of max­imum accumulation of these organisms in the sea floor. Surprisingly, the digital map of the seabed has revealed that there is a decoupling between the productivity of diatoms and the corresponding accumula­tion areas in the sea floor. The possibil"

While the birth rate number of births per thousand people is a parameter of the entire population, the fertility rate is a parameter of the female population of reproductive age generally to.

"The Open Government Partnership’s Civil Society Response Policy Commitment to Creating an Enabling Environment for CSOs The Open Government Partnership OGP is a multilateral initiative launched in. OGP member states, of which there are currently sixtynine, commit to becoming more transparent, accountable and responsive to their citizens. Member states must adopt the OGP Declaration, in which they commit to “protecting the ability of notforprofit and civil society organizations to operate in ways consistent with our commitment to freedom of expression, association, and opinion.” In September , the OGP Steering Committee adopted a policy for raising concerns with member states that are taking measures to restrict civic space, in contravention of OGP principles. So far, concerns have been submitted for four countries, including Azerbaijan, which has been deemed “inactive.” This status strips the designated country of voting rights within the OGP and limits its participation in OGP events."
"The organizers of the volume also asked us to consider whether AI will enhance or even replace the jobs of policy makers—whether improvements in machine learning and AI could be used on the policy making process itself. Personally, I do not think so because the most important policy matters are at their heart not issues of prediction. The technology may improve our ability to predict responses but it does not help us balance interests or engage in politics. We already know, for example, a great deal about the fiscal implications for social security of the aging population. Artificial intelligence might improve our ability to predict revenue outcomes of various policy options, say. That hasn’t been the problem with addressing social security. It has always been about choosing between options and making value judgments. The kinds of problems that AI helps with are those where large amounts of past data to inform the decision.

"The other possibility is provided by a dynamic, or online model. The model is used in a similar fashion to the static model. However, the difference is that the dynamic model is able to avail itself of input data in order to improve and adjust to changes. This may, for example, be necessary in connection with the monitoring of credit card transactions in order to reveal fraud. The transactions may change according to the user’s life situation, or in relation to his job, by for example taking place in completely new locations. These new usage patterns could well be labelled suspicious by a static model and potentially result in a blocked credit card. A model can therefore become less accurate over time if it is not continuously updated.One of the challenges here is that the input data is viewed in isolation. In many situations we work with information that has a context. For example, some words carry different meanings depending on their context. This context does not need to be formed "
The Polar Bear Challenge is day statewide event hosted by Utah’s Hogle Zoo. It is designed around the concept that polar bears and people want the same thing – a healthy planet. The Zoo is home to a female polar bear that is an ambassador for her species and a tangible way to teach the public about climate change. The Polar Bear Challenge provides teachers and students with a means to lower their carbon footprint by making small changes in their daily lives and lowering their impact on the planet’s natural resources. The Zoo challenges each class to make the changes for at least days the time it takes to start a new habit. Classrooms that make the greatest differences receive prizes from the Zoo and every participating class benefits polar bear conservation efforts and makes a positive impact on slowing down climate change. Pre and postsurvey results over the past five years have shown an increase in student understanding of climate change science and how their actions can make a diffe

"The potential risks of new technology need to be taken into account to ensure public acceptance. The scenarios confirm the high potential of ICT on the short and medium term and nanotechnology on the long term on manufacturing processes and the future organisation of the industry. However, new technological progress in ICT and nanotechnology will undoubtedly create new challenges and risks too. Policies towards sustainable manufacturing need to take into account issues related to the potential risks of new technology. Among the questions that need to be addressed are How does ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence increase the risks for unlawful and intrusive practices? What are the effects of ICT in future production processes and embedded in product devices on privacy and identity? Where are the potential conflict lines between public security and privacy? What are the risks for the environment of the widespread use of nanostructured materials? What are the consequences of the"

Complete prevalence represents the number of persons alive at certain point in time who previously had a diagnosis of the disease, regardless of how long ago the diagnosis was, or if the patient is still under treatment or is considered cured. Partial prevalence , which limits the number of patients to those diagnosed during a fixed time in the past, is a particularly useful measure of cancer burden. Prevalence of cancers based on cases diagnosed within one, three and five are presented as they are likely to be of relevance to the different stages of cancer therapy, namely, initial treatment one year, clinical followup three years and not yet cured five years. Patients who are still alive five years after diagnosis are usually considered cured since the death rates of su"

"The problem of searching for patterns in insurance data is fundamental to the actuarial profession and has an extensive literature going back many decades. Regardless of the context, many of the solutions reduce to one of parameter estimation. Whether the needed solution is to estimate parameters of a loss distribution, a regression model, or a lossdevelopment process, the basic problem of searching for patterns remains the same. A key decision as part of that analysis is how to segment the data. If we estimate the parameters for the entire population, the fitted model loses predictive power due to lack of specificity. Likewise, if we estimate the parameters for every possible slice of the data, the fitted model loses predictive power due to overfitting. Regardless of the problem or the industry, the modeler must find a balance between these two extremes. While our actuarial world approaches the segmentation issue with credibility and contextual solutions, the machinelearning domain wi"

Think tracking software being bundled into the download of another, quite different product.

"The prospects for point in the direction of the ongoing emigration of Venezuelans, as well as Nicaraguans, to countries in the region — in the case of Nicaraguans, almost exclusively to Costa Rica, due to the latter’s proximity and stability and the historical and migration links between both countries. This opens up several scenarios, for which we can anticipate a range of possible trends. First, while many Venezuelans have obtained residence permits in countries across the region, we can already see some countries closing their doors. This is most obvious in the case of Peru, where President Vizcarra announced at the end of October that the country will not continue to offer residence permits. Since migration flows will continue, this move might lead to numerous individuals ending up with undocumented status, increasing the risk of situations of exploitation.The reform of the Dublin system proved difficult to achieve in , even if the issue of European burdensharing continued to be re"

"The region’s passenger transport volume is generated primarily by suburban and commuter as well as metro services in the large conurbations of Brazil, Argentina and Chile. The significant growth of the transport performance in passenger rail transport as well as in urban rail transport is a result from the support of alternative means of transport in competition to road transport, because many South American conurbations are suffering from rapidly rising pollution, congestion and noise emissions. As a result, the market volumes for new metro vehicles as well as new electric multiple units EMU have a share of around XX in the total market for new railway vehicles in South and Central America.

"The Santa Cruz Police Department SCPD in Santa Cruz, California has adopted machine learning techniques for predictive policing. The SCPD uses a realtime predictive algorithm to identify the fifteen x meter squares in the city of Santa Cruz that are at highest risk for crime at any one time. The department shares this information with its officers, who can then devote more of their shift time to these areas. One important aspect to this policy is that the algorithm is not attempting to replace the judgment of police officers on the street or give orders. Instead, the algorithm gener­ates a simple prediction that is one of many factors that officers use when deciding where to patrol. One crime analyst with the SCPD described pre­dictive policing as similar to an algorithm that tells fishermen where fish are it can help them be better at their jobs, but it can’t replace them. Santa Cruz saw a fourteen percent drop in burglaries after the algorithm was implemented. The department finds pr"

Elmore argues that testbased accountability has been more enduring in education than any other policy in the United States for at least the past years and that it is unlikely to change in the near future. According to Hamilton , the policy context in the United States is characterised by the use of tests in what may be called a testbased accountability system. These systems involve four major elements goals, expressed in the form of standards measures of performance i.e. tests targets for performance and consequences attached to schools’ success or failure at meeting the targets.

"The study results revealed that AI was primarily covered in American newspapers via the topics of Business and Econ­omy and Science and Technology. Notably, the topic of eth­ics has been increasingly discussed in recent years. A close examination of the articles that discussed ethics or moral is­sues as the dominant topic indicated that both positive and negative aspects were addressed. For instance, a news article discussed the use of AI to combat unethical wildlife trade. However, most news articles did not discuss a particular eth­ical issue indepth, but raised general questions about poten­tial ethical concerns, such as privacy and misuse of AI in the title, introduction, or conclusion paragraph, without provid­ing specific discussions.

"The supply of housing for the poor is one of the biggest challenges for governments. Neither the public nor the private sector has been able to supply affordable housing at a scale that meets the needs of the urban poor. Singapore is the rare exception, but this is the result of its unique circumstances the city is small and without a rural hinterland its economy has expanded rapidly much of the land is publicly owned after large acquisitions in the early years and the government is committed to adequately house the entire population. Elsewhere, many urban poor live in underserviced informal housing or “slums” table. To be near incomegenerating opportunities, the poor tend to use innercity land that is disasterprone, unsuitable for development or waiting to be commercially developed.

"The system hit the first wall when early adopting states pulled back on signing new RE PPAs. RE development will hit a second wall when RErich states are forced to curtail RE or demand compensation for their high RE percentage in part to cover the fixed costs of nonRE generation capacity. For example, the state of Karna­taka has peak demand of about. GW and roughly GW of RE capacity. The state expects GW of total solar by , based on already sanctioned projects, including the world’s largest , MW solar park in Pavagada. On the other hand, approximately GW of additional coal power capacity can come online within the year from new stateowned assets. But the state cannot absorb all this supply in the near term. The gov­ernment of Karnataka understands that this high level of RE brings costs, but does not have mechanisms to cover them. Owing to a lack of integrated planning mechanisms, the answer across India thus far has been to pass these costs onto consumers.In , the central government t"
"The theory of change and joint work of UNICEF and UNFPA build on the available evidence and a decade of both agencies’ programming experience on reaching adolescent girls. Data and evidence show that child marriage is driven by many interrelated structural, economic and sociocultural factors. The programme views the persistence of child marriage as the result of a broad combination of structural and socio­cultural drivers. As more evidence becomes available, the roles of poverty and shocks in prompting early marriage remain important, but a greater understanding of how sociocultural norms and practices contribute to the challenge have become more apparent. Children are traditionally not afforded voice or agency in their marriage decisions, and strong incentives to conform to traditional or community practices encourage the practice of child marriage even where the dangers are known.

"The UK has a mixed track record at linking its strong university and government R and D base to private innovation. The share of businessfunded R and D in these sectors has halved since to just five per cent, ranking it far below competitors as diverse as Germany, the Netherlands, Turkey, China, Australia, Finland, Spain, South Korea and Canada. This is despite per cent of all R and D activities in the UK being funded from overseas – the highest rate in the OECD area, highlighting the UK’s strong reputation. In , despite producing per cent of the world’s most highlycited academic journal articles second only to the US, the UK managed to record just. per cent of global patent applications. This is due in part to a smaller percentage of total research spending on business enterprise activity than many other nations. In other words, the UK’s research tends to be more ‘fundamental’, considering basic scientific principles, than commercially applied. However, looking at overall rates of col"
"The UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, who was appointed to succeed David Cameron, has made it clear in a speech made on January , , that she does not see a future for the UK in the Single Market. Although she has not made it clear, it appears likely that she also wishes to exit the EU Customs Union. However, while on the one hand suggesting a complete extrication from the “onion”, she has also said that she would like this to be accompanied by a comprehensive free trade agreement with the EU. The points made in May’s speech were reiterated in a “White Paper” a UK Government policy document published on February ,. Although the White Paper was hailed as a “plan” for Brexit, it contains very little new information on the UK Government’s intentions and appears to have been written in a hurry in order to satisfy demands for a White Paper, rather than to address the mechanics of Brexit in any detail. Crucial issues remain unresolved by the White Paper. For example there is, as yet, no detaile"
"The unique feature of the drupa Trends Reports is its global expert panel, recruited around the world from visitors to drupa. By publishing this global survey every year we can track the key market, regional and technological trends over time. However even with a lengthy survey we cannot drill down into as much detail as is asked of us each year – busy people simply do not have the time. Hence from this year we have added an optional additional survey that allows us to examine in more detail one hot topic. This year’s Spotlight is on inkjet printing, perhaps the decisive technological print development in recent years, and will be published in May.As last year a lack of demand creating strong competition were reported as the two most common constraints to growth by both printers and suppliers.

"The VCMM is a proprietary financial simulation tool developed and maintained by Vanguard’s Investment Strategy Group. The model forecasts distributions of future returns for a wide array of broad asset classes. Those asset classes include U.S. and international equity markets, several maturities of the U.S. Treasury and corporate fixed income markets, international fixed income markets, U.S. money markets, commodities, and certain alternative investment strategies. The theoretical and empirical foundation for the Vanguard Capital Markets Model is that the returns of various asset classes reflect the compensation investors require for bearing different types of systematic risk beta. At the core of the model are estimates of the dynamic statistical relationship between risk factors and asset returns, obtained from statistical analysis based on available monthly financial and economic data. Using a system of estimated equations, the model then applies a Monte Carlo simulation method to pr"

"The vulnerability of countries to perceived risk from dependence on imported food has prompted some governments to support the cultivation of staple crops in the region Box. Unfortunately, rigorous recent calculations of government support to or implicit taxes on producers have not been widely undertaken for the region, and to date have been made for only three countries with the latest year of available data from. The nominal rate of assistance NRA is defined as the percentage by which government policies have raised gross returns to farmers above what they would be without the governments intervention or lowered them, if NRA.

"The west of Scotland generates the largest number of trips of all the regions of Scotland, with an average of , trips per annum. The west also generates the largest average of nights and expenditure than any other region with. million nights and £ million in expenditure respectively. Interestingly the north of Scotland, which generates the second highest level of figures in regards to volume and value, also generates the highest average level of spend per trip and night, as well as generating the longest length of stay than any other region in Scotland. This increase in spend for the north of Scotland could be attributed to the longer journey times within the northern region. It should also be noted that the size of the western market could be attributed to nostalgic trips taken by older consumers revisiting popular holiday destinations, which were traditionally found on the west coast of Scotland.In terms of domestic day visits to Scottish seaside, coastline, and beach trips, the majo"
"The World Family Map essay suggests that the family contexts of caregiving deserve attention in ongoing efforts to improve children’s health around the world. The essay specifically explores the relationship between family instability—measured here by divorce or dissolution of a cohabiting relationship, widowhood, or repartnership, either through marriage or cohabitation—and children’s health. Three measures of child health are explored to cover different types of indicators of health diarrhea, an acute illness stunting, a longerterm measure of health resulting from chronic nutritional deprivation or repeated episodes of poor food intake, disease, or both and child mortality, the ultimate negative health outcome. Data from international Demographic and Health Surveys DHS are analyzed from developing countries in CentralSouth America and the Caribbean, Africa, Asia and the Middle East.

"The World Watch Research unit works closely with researchers in the field to collect survey data, designed to tease out the state of religious freedom for Christians in five areas of life private, family, community, national and within the church. These five areas comprise the ‘squeeze’ nonviolent element of persecution – the daily pressure of official discrimination, hostile attitudes and family rejection. Separately, the team measures violence against Christians. This is the ‘smash’ violent element of persecution, one that often commands headlines but is rarely the dominant reality for Christians who live in World Watch List countries. For each country surveyed, scores for the six categories are combined to create a total out of a possible hundred. Those scores determine the country’s ranking on the World Watch List. Only verified accounts of persecution are analysed, with many incidents in North Korea, Libya and Myanmar amongst other countries going unrecorded due to the difficulty "
"The x “medium rectangle” ad format on mobile is a carryover from the desktop advertising world, where it often appears in the right rail of websites it doesn’t see as much traction on mobile in the U.S. these days. Yet we saw it grow in terms of revenue in APAC last year. Why? As mobile advertising catches up in popularity in this region, many publishers and advertisers in APAC may still be in the desktopfirst mindset and translating desktop assets to mobile. In addition, the MREC format can be made to look similar to an interstitial if the areas above and below it are grayed out or a native ad depending where it’s placed in relation to content. In this case, the versatility of MREC may help improve fill rates, compared to newer formats like native for which demand may be lower. As the APAC region goes through its own growth curve, it will be interesting to keep an eye on the fate of older formats like MREC and compare their trajectory to what we’ve seen in the U.S.The APAC region offe"

"There are a variety of perspectives on AI safety and ethics in the Chinese AI community. Doubling as a launch event for the aforementioned book, the CAICT hosted a seminar in November on the unique challenges AI poses for law and governance. Attendees included representatives from the Supreme People’s Court, Weixing Shen, dean of Tsinghua University law school, and Si Xiao, Tencent’s Chief Research Officer. From the readout of the conference, it appears that participants offered robust and, often differing, views on how to govern AI development. For instance, Dean Shen stated that AI development was an immutable social trend that should be embraced rather than excessively worried over, whereas Guobin Li, president of the Beijing Research Institute for Communication Law, argued that scholars should proactively address the legal and policy issues that could arise from AI. The growing efforts of Chinese scholars to tackle difficult questions of AI governance means that assessing the relat"
"There are also transformations that don’t change the nu­merical operations in an essential way, such as transform­ing pounds into euros today p .e, or degrees Celsius into Fahrenheit c f ·. Notice that a change of currency only involves scaling, since zero pounds always corresponds to zero euros or zero in any other currency. This means that statements such as ‘this costs twice as much as that’ are meaningful regardless of the currency – currency scales are said to be of ratio scale type. In contrast, if two ob­ject’s temperatures are. and. Celsius then it doesn’t make sense to say that the second object is twice as hot as the frst. Only ratios of differences are meaningful here e.g., one could say ‘in the previous hour the patient’s body tempera­ture increased twice as much as in the hour before’ which does not depend on the temperature scale used – temperature scales are said to be of interval scale type. So ratio scales are invariant under scaling x. ax only whereas interval scales "
"There are business sectors in North America that stand out for their sustainability reporting presence and activity. These sectors are the energy and energy utilities, financial services, food and beverage, and mining. These sectors are the most proactive when it comes to disclosing the data and information on their business activities and operations. For instance, the energy sector is active in the sustainability reporting area due to its large environmental and social impact on the areas where it operates. Also, in the financial sector the sustainability reporting is a means for companies to present to clients, and society in general, their responsible profile and operations, and to communicate with investors and attract new ones. In the U.S., the most active sector is the energy and energy utilities sector and in Canada the most active sector is the mining sector.Sustainability Reports are organizational reports that provide information on economic, environmental, and social perform"
"There are numerous ways to limit the risk from pandemics. Firstly, pharma­ceutical companies could focus atten­tion on developing vaccines and drugs for very damaging pandemics, and the international community can remove barriers to development with measures such as the establishment of a glob­al vaccine development fund. Sec­ondly, governments and international bodies such as the WHO can stockpile drugs and vaccines to counter disease outbreaks. However, stockpiles may only be effective for some but not all pandemic pathogens. Thirdly, since developing countries will probably face the highest burden from future pandemics, continued improvements in developing world health systems in accordance with the WHO’s Inter­national Health Regulations, and im­provements in the global distribution of drugs and vaccines, would limit the risk from pandemics. Fourthly, dis­ease surveillance and response sys­tems could be improved so that nov­el threats in both animal and human populations are detect"
"There are various views as to the drivers of health care spending. In developed markets, it’s expected that aging populations will continue to be a major factor—especially in Japan, where the share of people over age will reach almost percent by , and in Western Europe, with its share nearing percent. Changing patterns of care, including increased visits and higherquality services, could also be major costdrivers. Therapeutic advances and the desires of doctors and patients are prompting more and more costly tests and interventions for chronic and communicable diseases. Providers, payers, and life sciences companies may have to balance the development and adoption of new therapies and medical technologies with their potential quality, experience, and health outcomes. In developing markets, growing populations, an increase in higherincome households, and rising consumer expectations are pushing up health costs. In addition, health systems are dealing with the ongoing challenges of conta"
"There is a danger that when marketers see their social shares fall, they may look to produce more viral content and headlines to gain shares. There are a number of problems with this approach. Firstly, broadening the content to get shares may lose the focus on the core commercial audience. Secondly, there is evidence that audiences get tired of very similar viral content headlines and formats. Thirdly, given Facebook are actively punishing headlines that withhold information or use exaggerated terms, there is a need to be careful when trying to create viral content.The one area where we still see millions of people regularly share content is music videos. The most shared music video on Youtube in was ‘Despacito’ with over m shares on social networks and m likes on Youtube itself. This was higher than Coldplay’s ‘Hymn for the weekend’ that gained .m shares in or Adele’s ‘Hello’ which gained m shares in. So if you’re in the business of creating viral music videos, things are looking good"
"There is a sizeable amount of evidence that internships benefit early career outcomes. Data from those with relevant work experience indicate people with internship experience end up in the field of study that maximizes their investment in education while setting an individual on a career path. Internships are a good option for gaining work experience, and percent of college graduates have had an internship by the time they graduate, as of. This change is a percent increase from a study and a percent increase from a survey from Northwestern University. As internships have become a source of competitive advantage for graduates, companies are turning to paid internships, seeing a. percentage point increase over the last seven years. The increase in the number of paid internships may be due to wanting to attract as much talent as possible, and it also makes it possible for those who cannot forgo an income to intern instead of taking paid work unrelated to their chosen career path.

"There is ample evidence that private corporations are responding to the realities of the energy transformation by restructuring and adjusting, and increasing renewables generation. Following dramatic declines in market capitalization, Germany’s largest utility companies, RWE and E.ON, both split their businesses into two parts, one focused on renewables and the other on thermal generation. Danish Oil and Natural Gas DONG changed its name to rsted after selling off its oil and gas business. Total is diversifying into solar and battery technology. Shell is growing its natural gas portfolio relative to oil. BP and other oil com­panies are buying into electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

Some global technology companies already source of their electricity from renewable energy. These trends indicate that global technol"
"There is tremendous potential for developing crossborder production networks and regional value chains across the Commonwealth regions. Several member countries are located in regions with much recognised comparative advantage in particular sectors. The textiles and clothing sector in South Asia, for example, involves four Commonwealth members Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, fetching more than billion in exports collectively for the region, and providing employment to close to million people directly and more than million indirectly. While each of the four countries sources the majority of its inputs for exports from outside the region, the region is also exporting the same to global markets. It has been estimated – in a study undertaken jointly by the Commonwealth Secretariat, UNCTAD, and the Centre for WTO Studies – that the untapped potential for intraregional and therefore intraCommonwealth trade in the sector could be more than five times the existing level of million.

"There may be many ‘hidden’ layers between the input layer and output layer, and these are used to extract more information by exploiting structure in the data. A network is considered ‘deep’ if it has more than one hidden layer see diagram opposite which illustrates the complexity of a neural network. Neural networks are great at solving problems where the data is highly structured – like an image of a brain scan – but are a ‘black box’ algorithm. In other words, it is hard to describe the patterns they find to a human being.An example might be that a GP creates a model based on a year’s worth of patient data, to see if there is a pattern to the type of complaints she has seen in that year. The model might show that people living in a certain area have higher rates of cancer and this warrants further examination is there an issue with water supply? Is there pollution from a nearby factory?.Many major advances in machine learning actually occur from datasets, not algorithms. When IBM’s "
"There may be some rationale for including utility basic service options with aboveRPS renewable energy as green power, if the utility retires the RECs for its ratepayers. In restructured markets and in jurisdictions with CCAs, utility basic service is in fact a customer choice—though many customers may be unaware of the choice. If the utility provides more renewable energy than local competitive suppliers or the local CCA and a customer chooses to remain with the utility in order to buy more renewable energy, one could argue the customer has voluntarily procured renewable electricity through their decision to continue with utility basic service. As long as utilities retire aboveRPS RECs on behalf of their ratepaying customers, there should be no potential for double claims to the renewable electricity. Indeed, from this perspective, it is unclear how green power claims based on aboveRPS utility basic service differ from green power claims based on aboveRPS competitive supplier or CCA s"
"There were two major developments during which will shape the financial landscape in the years to come and will also be instrumental in furthering financial inclusion. First, inprinciple approvals for setting up payments banks to eleven applicants were granted on August , and on September , , inprinciple approvals were granted to ten applicants for setting up small finance banks SFBs. Accordingly, two entities – the Capital Small Finance Limited and Equitas Small Finance Bank Limited – commenced operations as small finance banks, while Airtel Payments Bank Limited began operating as the first payments bank. Secondly, on August , guidelines for ‘on tap’ licensing of universal banks in the private sector were released.

"Thirdly, for African migration streams, although international migration has received more attention in recent debates on migration, internal migration within individual African states is far more significant in terms of the numbers of people involved and perhaps even the quantum of remittances and poverty reduction potential of these UNDP,. Within internal movements, the importance of temporary and seasonal migration for multilocal households and diversified livelihoods is especially critical. Seasonal, circular and other forms of short term mobility is especially important in Africa as these are the migrants who are likely to be more vulnerable once they move to the city, and in need of specific social protection policies. Temporary movement, often but not necessarily on a seasonal basis, has long underpinned the diversification of income sources by rural households and, importantly, by urban households. Migration is a key element of income diversification. Research on rural–urban li"

We start by arguing that neutral real interest rates are best estimated for the block of all industrial economies given capital mobility between them and relatively limited fuctuations in their collective current account. We show, using standard econometric procedures and looking at direct market indicators of prospective real rates, that neutral real interest rates have declined by at least basis points over the last generation. We argue that these secular movements are in larger part a refection of changes in saving and investment propensities rather than the safety and liquidity properties of Treasury instruments. We then point out that the movements in the neutral real rate refect both developments in the private sector and in public"

"This rapid digital shift is being driven in part by the growing number of connected consumers, the expansion of mobile telephony, and elevated mobile broadband adoption. As it continues, it will not only expand the digital share of the media wallet, but have a structural effect on almost all media subsectors, redefining business models. For example, we see a growing move away from “bundled” media, such as that offered by traditional cable TV, to what might be termed “selfservice rebundling”—consumers picking and choosing from a variety of online streaming services to create their own, more streamlined personal programming bundles. As the number of directtoconsumer services increases and the number of smart devices grows, the ability of consumers to selfserve the entertainment they desire will increase as well. We expect global pay TV growth to moderate as a result, with the rise of overthetop OTT online options influencing consumer preferences and ultimately leading to cordcutting—subs"

"This trend is projected to grow substantially not only in the next five to ten years, but also further into the future – it is estimated that by the global population will be over billion, per cent of whom will live in cities. Such growth will continue to put strain both on resources and on existing infrastructure such as the availability of safe drinking water, electricity networks, transport networks, waste management and property ownership. An approach has started to develop to identify and try to provide solutions to these problems through a number of initiatives variously badged as smart cities, eco cities, safe cities, resilient cities or future cities to indicate a particular focus on the system. For the purpose of this report we shall use the generic term Smart Cities to refer to the “effective integration of physical, digital and human systems in the built environment to deliver sustainable, prosperous and inclusive future for its citizens”.The integration will require some ad"

"This working paper explores longrun patterns in the strategies of international business in developing countries. There was a massive wave of Western multinational investment in the developing world during the first wave of globalization before the s. The subsequent decades of deglobalization saw the proportion of world FDI in developing countries sharply decline, and it has remained far below pre levels during the second global economy beginning in the s. The working paper shows how management strategies were shaped by context in each historical period which provided a mixture of opportunity and risk. In the first wave of globalization, MNEs sought access to resources, and governments frequently gave them exclusive contracts and favorable deals in order to build businesses. The major management challenge was to overcome logistical challenges to enable minerals and other commodities to be exported into global value chains. During the Great Reversal, the main challenges faced by MNEs we"

"Time Series Forecasting. Largescale time series prediction or forecasting problems have received attention from the ML, statistics and econometrics community. The problem of forecasting the future values of a time series arises in numerous scientifc felds and commercial applications. In retail, an accurate forecast of product demand can result in signifcant cost reductions through optimal inventory management and allocation. In mod­ern applications, many time series need to be forecasted for simultaneously. Classical forecasting techniques, such as ARIMA models , or exponential smoothing and its statespace formulation train a single model per time series. Since these approaches are typically fast to train , , it is possible to retrain the models every time a new forecast needs to be generated. In theory, this would mean that little to no management of the resulting models is required however, the practice very often differs signifcantly. While classical forecast­ing models excel when t"

"To encourage more companies to follow suit, it is critical that business leaders cultivate a better understanding of migration and that they learn how to assess migrants’ skills so that they can be transferred in a way that ensures their longterm employability. International transferability of skills remains an issue, as Dumont remarks. First it is crucial that recently arrived migrants invest in host country language skills. It is also important to assess professional and informal skills in order to identify employment or retraining opportunities. A car mechanic originating from a lessdeveloped country may be excellent in his job but may lack some of the skills needed to repair a car with lot of electronic devices. For such a case it is necessary to build on existing skills rather than to ignore them. Even in the most highly regulated professions, such as medicine and law, the transferability of knowledge and experience can be lengthy and costly, but worth investing in. Whatever their"
"To ensure fairness, when a code submission was evaluated, a compute worker was dedicated to processing that submission only, and its execution time was limited to a given time budget which may vary from dataset to dataset. The time budget was provided to the participants with each dataset in its info .le. It was generally set to seconds minutes per dataset, for practical reasons, except in the .rst phase of the .rst round. However, the participants did not know this ahead of time and therefore their code had to be capable to manage a given time budget. The participants who submitted results instead of code were not constrained by the time budget since their code was run on their own platform. This was potentially advantageous for entries counting towards the Final phases immediately following a Tweakathon. Participants wishing to also enter the AutoML blind testing phases, which required submitting code, could submit both results and code simultaneously. When results were submitted, th"
"To get a true sense of the growth in the online loan market, funded loan volumes and number of funded loans were measured over the fiveyear period.

"Trade actions boost U.S. downstream. President Trumps decision earlier this year to impose tariffs of on steel and on aluminum from all countries is a moderately positive factor for U.S.based steel and aluminum producers, but also entails cost and working capital pressures for domestic metals consumers and processors. Additional trade actions from the U.S. and China may conceal some risk for the global economy, but over the short term we expect them further support domestic production in the U.S., underpinning companies current or even stronger fundamentals. U.S. steel imports dropped by about yeartodate August versus last year. While we expect the lower imports to help sustain higher prices for domestic competitors in the near term, we also predict some risk of modest import pressure persisting, primarily because of the lack of confidence in the sustainability of the current steel tariffs. In our view, these policy actions will encourage some domestic production, raise utilization rat"
"Traditionally, product design requires that materials satisfy a predetermined set of property and performance requirements Ashby. While design engineers do their best to avoid narrowing their list of potential materials until as late as possible in the design process, in practice, they are left with a static list of material choices well before product optimization. Typically, material choice is optimized through combinatorial means such as data mining and visualization McDowell and Olson. This independence of materials engineering from product design is inefficient. From a materials perspective, it leads to conservative designs that do not take advantage of the full capabilities of a material Pollock Brinson Anonymous on ICME. Hence, one likely evolutionary breakthrough will be utilizing materials to their fullest by enabling the design engineer to delay specific material choices to later stages of the productdevelopment process.

"Training dataset Does the training data already exist? Or does it have to be created manually? How much training data is needed for the algorithm to be trained? In most projects, particularly in areas where the data may be scarce, the creation of a required representative training dataset may be one of the main drivers of cost for the project, as it can involve intense manual labor. In other cases, it may be readily available. This can easily be the most important and expensive part of the project, as the model, and any result that comes from it, is inherently tied to the quality of the data that is input. An old adage goes “garbage in, garbage out.” In other words, a model is only as good as its input data.

"Understanding to whom antibiotics are prescribed can assist with planning stewardship activities. Unfortunately, sales data do not easily lend themselves to analysis of consumption by specific groups, for example, by age. We therefore used the type of formulation as a proxy for age, assuming that the defined CAFs would be prescribed to children aged years and using corresponding popula­tion denominators. The classification of CAFs was devel­oped by two senior paediatric research pharmacists but is somewhat subjective.

"Unlike previous years, the monthly phishing volume for financial institutions stayed relatively consistent in. Emailonline services and SaaS companies both saw an increase in phishing activity as the year progressed. Conversely, attacks targeting cloud storage services, payment services, and ecommerce companies decreased throughout the year. While the overall yearly volume of phishing attacks targeting payment services was much higher than in , nearly a third of that volume occurred during a short, threemonth timespan at the beginning of the year. Attacks against ecommerce companies gradually decreased throughout the year with an exception of a onemonth spike in April, when volume increased by percent. The timing of this spike corresponds with the end of tax return season, so it’s possible that phishers were targeting the ecommerce industry when people often have more money to spend.On June , , NotPetya, which also leverages the exploits leaked by The Shadow Brokers, quickly locked dow"
"Up front, it is important to understand that technology is not a driver of change in a vacuum. The rapid technology innovation is itself driven by people. In this context, we are defining people as a combination of changing demography, which is increasingly tech savvy, and the rise of greater consumer empowerment. There are also two systemic change drivers that are playing out in the supply chain environment, in reaction to all the technological innovation. These are globalisation and geopolitics. All the change drivers discussed in our interviews are not considered to be acting independently of each other. They are intertwined across a spider’s web, with technology at its centre as the most important disrupter impacting the finance function currently. As the finance function moves from working in isolation to working with others in an organisation, so the people driver of change will have a greater impact.Today we chuckle when we ask Amazon’s Echo, Apple’s Siri or Microsoft’s Cortana "
"Users search for the cursormouse in very different and unique ways. Some use wide search patterns, others use small ones, some are horizontal while others are diagonal, and certain users always search counterclockwise. Sometimes users move on a certain learning curve and their responses vary according to their location on the curve. All these can be captured as unique parameters, however, typically this is not practical, because the time required for the user to provide enough relevant mouse movements to accurately authenticate themselves is too long. Invisible Challenges unconsciously “forces” the user to make various mouse movements in a very short time, allowing BioCatch to capture adequate data from the user in milliseconds. This makes it useful for detecting anomalies in user behavior in near realtime.BioCatch is a cybersecurity company that delivers behavioral biometrics, analyzing humandevice interactions to protect users and data.

"Using a gravity model allows casual observations about the recent trade slowdown to be put into perspective, with a benchmark analysis of its structural determinants. Our analysis shows that trade growth since indeed fell short of what a preCrisis structural model of trade growth would have predicted. Lower GDP growth compared to the preCrisis period thus explains part, but not all, of the recent trade slowdown. Further examination shows that this structural change is not evenly shared. Compared to what might have been expected based on GDP growth rates, the slowdown was especially severe for Chinese imports, and worldwide in metal products, machinery and electrical and optical equipments. More generally, the slowdown proved more pronounced for trade flows where participation in GVCs was more widespread. Beyond the rebalancing and structural change of the Chinese economy, the recent trade slowdown thus seems to reflect an inflexion in the development of GVCs. While the underlying deter"

Whereas of Germans approve in principle of taking in refugees and support taking in more now, of Czechs are against taking any. How to explain this discrepancy? The Economist, September, “Those arriving have been raised in another religion, and represent a radically different culture. Most of them are not Christians, but Muslims,” Mr. Orban wrote in a commentary for Frankfurt Allgemeine Zeitung, a German newspaper. “This is an important question, because Europe and European identity is rooted in Christianity.” “Is it not worrying in itself that European Christianity is now barely able to keep Europe Christian?” Mr. Orban asked. “There is no alternative, and we have no option but to defend our borders.” “I want to underline that for me, Christianity in public and social life means a duty to our brothe"

"WaiChung Ho’s article provides an example of China’s homogenization via education with the case study of Hong Kong. The famed “Handover” of Hong Kong. Originally, Hong Kong wanted to remain under British authority claiming that they enjoyed the political and economic freedoms of liberalism. Beijing respected this for many years, even incorporating the split ideology into political jargon with “onecountry, two systems”. Slowly, though, China has been encroaching on Hong Kong’s autonomy in many domains, including education. Ho speaks to how creators of curriculum needed to selfcensor when writing about certain divisive subjects such as the Tiananmen Square protest of as an example of China creating its own history. He goes on to speak of “official knowledge centers” that must approve all curricula written, as well as the implementation of the Chinese national civic education as a means to counteract British influence. However, the article also states that in a phone survey of Chinese stu"

The DOJs lawsuit to stop ATT Inc. from merging with Time Warner Inc., and Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc.s effort to buy Tribune Media Co. are also on the agenda. Congress has threatened to hold hearings on these media transactions, making the regulatory and court proceedings likely to become part of the political theater.

"WBG CPFs for countries above the IBRD GDI level will take a systematic approach to the trajectory towards IBRD graduation. Borrowing countries’ decision to graduate from IBRD involves a dialogue between the country and the Bank, and takes place on a casebycase basis reflecting country context. The key elements of the IBRD graduation policy are the nonincome factors, namely, extent of access to external capital markets on reasonable terms, and progress in establishing key institutions for economic and social development. Going forward, in close cooperation with the borrowing country, there will be a systematic analysis and assessment of the key elements of the IBRD graduation policy, reflected in the CPFs, and updated in Performance and Learning Reviews PLRs. In consultation with the borrowing country, new IBRD activities will have a primary focus on interventions to strengthen policies and institutions required for sustainable IBRD graduation.

"We look into the growth of public cloud vs. private cloud through workload and compute instance analysis. Public cloud, as indicated by the workloads and compute instances growth, is growing faster than the private cloud. As the business sensitivity to costs associated with dedicated IT resources grows along with demand for agility, we can see a greater adoption of public cloud by the businesses, especially with strengthening of public cloud security. Although many missioncritical workloads and compute instances might continue to be retained in the traditional data centers or private cloud, the public cloud adoption is increasing along with the gain in trust in public cloud. Some enterprises might adopt a hybrid approach to cloud. In a hybrid cloud environment, some of the cloud computing resources are managed inhouse by an enterprise and some are provided by an external provider. Cloud bursting is an example of hybrid cloud where daily computing requirements are handled by a private c"

Interannual variability tends to be dominated by the tropical Southern Oscillation, the El NioLa Nia cycle. During the tropics have moved from the La Nia phase upper left map in Figure to a weak El Nio lower right map in Figure. NOAA predicts a chance that the tropical warmth will continue at least through the coming Northern Hemisphere spring and be classified as an El Nio. However, models show a broad range of possibilities for the development of tropical temperature some models have the weak El Niolike warmth fading rapidly in. The El Nio situation will become clear during the next few months. If a substantial El Nio develops, global temperature is expected to rise, although it is unlikely that the El Nio will approach the strength of the El Nio.Continuing changes in global climate forcings also affect global temperature.

This growing impact of climate change is also showcased by the increase in average insured loss per year to USb in the last years excluding vs. ~USb for the preceding two decades all values inflation adjusted, and is expected to deteriorate further. Insurers, therefore, must adapt by building capabilities and capacities to offer products better suited to client needs without straining books significantly and shift from risk management to incentivizing risk prevention among customers.Technology is changing the nature of risk and is enabling new products, services and channels. It is already opening and will continue to open doors for new entrants that will compete and behave in ways very different from the incumbents. To succeed in this environment insurers will need to fully engage –and sometimes be the driving force behind the creation of ecosystems that spa"
"What this means for museums A growing segment of society with relatively less money could result in fewer discretionary purchases like museum admissions, reinforcing the perception that museums exist only to serve the elite. Concentration of wealth also affects the potential size of the donor base.The recent wave of museum expansion was funded, in large part, by the accumulation of wealth among the highest earners rather than an increase in the number of wealthy Americans. In the wake of the recent economic crisis, many nonprofits are already concerned about their ability to collect on pledged donations. When Japan suffered a longduration economic downturn in the s, it led to a dissipation of corporate and individual support for the arts.Will the same happen in the United States? Museums may have to reconsider their funding models either way, relying more on donations from the economic elite if wealth continues to concentrate or on earned income and a wide base of donor support if the "
"When a trend analysis involves both nonlinearity and covariates and the analyst wishes to fit a joinpoint regression model to the trend, it is desirable to take the covariates into account when selecting the joinpoint model, so that the estimates for each time point reflect adjustment for the covariates and their interactions. Using adjusted estimates usually affects the trend model that is fit including the intercept of the model, the location of any joinpoints, and the slopes of the line segments because the trend may vary for different combinations of covariate values. If NCI’s Joinpoint software will be used to estimate joinpoints in the trend, the approach used for the trend analysis will differ somewhat from that used when there are no covariates because the covariates cannot be input directly into the software. If the covariates can be represented by a small number of subgroups and the sample sizes are sufficient, one approach is to treat the covariates as “by” variables and use"
"When analyzing retail sales data of organic and Fairtrade products, it is important to take into account that the variety of Fairtrade products is smaller than that of organic products. Currently, consumers can find almost all food products in organic quality, while the scope of Fairtrade products is smaller.

For a processed product to be labelled as organic, at least percent of the ingredients of the final product need to be from organiccertified raw materials IFOAM – Organics International.

"When choosing among approaches to working on a particular problem or cause area, individuals and organisations should use empirical evidence to estimate which approach will be most effective. In some fields, for example in development economics, there has been a large increase in the availability of highquality studies, including randomised controlled trials, estimating the effect of different interventions or programmes. However, it is often not clear how to combine information from different studies, particularly when they were undertaken in different settings or use different empirical methods, even if they are evaluating essentially the same intervention. For other questions of interest, it is inherently more difficult and sometimes impossible to run randomised trials, and we must use information from other sources, including theoretical models and other types of empirical evidence, to make informed judgements.

Sure, I was “obligated” to take a course in Human Resources as part of the curriculum, but the terminology was as foreign to me as having to learn Russian. Terms like “employee wellbeing, motivation, empowerment, and employee satisfaction” seemed incredibly intangible, yet needed to be ingrained into my thought process if I ever had senior management pretentions.

"When the purple curve in Figure is much higher than the orange curve, the algorithm performs substantially better on the “forecasting” data than on the testing data. This typically happens when the priorities in the rolling window are dicult for the model to learn well. In this case, we argue that the false positives in the testing data are the articles that best indicate the policy priorities to come. Imagine two factions inside the party leadership, reformists and conservatives, who in the training window disagreed on privatization. The “paradigm” the algorithm forms — say, proprivatization — would inevitably work poorly. This is because proprivatization articles may go on the front page on one day but may not on another false positives, and whether they do is driven by factors that cannot be detected from the newspaper itself such as power struggle inside the Party. But then in the new quarter, most proprivatization articles may come on the front page, which would confrm the “paradi"

Innovation plays a big part in agility thinking ahead, taking managed risks and learning constructively from mistakes helps organisations to evolve in line with change, and more importantly in anticipation of future change. The risktaking part is actually quite key. Fear of failure is a common reason organisations don’t take managed risks.

"Whether poverty tours are advertised online, in print, or in films, it is important that tour companies market the region of the tours appropriately, given that poverty is a serious issue around the world. In other words, companies should be careful with their vocabulary so that they do not stray away from the actual meaning and purpose of their tours. Misleading potential tourists into thinking that a poverty tour is fun and exciting, just like Kibera Tours did, poorly represents poverty tourism. For example, Real Bronx Tours gave tours around the Bronx in New York, but was later shut down due to the demands of city council members. A letter to the tour company stated, “We are more than happy to welcome tours to our community that celebrate the rich culture and history of our neighborhoods, but using the Bronx to sell a socalled ‘ghetto’ experience to tourists is completely unacceptable” Murphy.

"While a significant amount of discussion has focused on the risks that technology brings along with the vast potential benefits it offers, it was also brought to mind that technology at this point in time, primarily remains a tool. Concerns were rife as delegates questioned the ethical concerns surrounding technology, as speakers pointed out in their respective sessions that despite the validity of such reservations, it is the human factor that contributes to the heightened risks. It was also demonstrated in a survey on economic crime and fraud that the advent of technology has not necessarily led to cybercrime being the number one cause of fraud.They advocated that fundamentally, the role of internal audit has not changed it is the execution of the internal audit strategy and how this looks like, which are no longer the same, as technology and digitisation revolutionise work processes to require accommodation of agility and flexibility with the swiftness of change.

"While banks cite growth as the most common reason to invest in technology Figure , we believe they tend to overestimate the power of technology in driving business growth. As highlighted in EY’s Global Consumer Banking Survey, technology is undoubtedly a critical tool that can help banks tailor better products and deliver improved customer experiences, which in turn can help them to win greater wallet share from their existing client base. Banks’ investments in customer technology to date have largely been focused on frontend interfaces, reflecting their response to changing customer behaviors and competitive pressures. However, there is little evidence that such tactical initiatives have materially grown the business, as opposed to simply stemming customer leakage. New channels and products can often be replicated, and in many instances being a fast follower may be better than being a first mover.EY’s FinTech Adoption Index highlights that “consumers are drawn to FinTech services beca"
"While growth in reserves in China has been particularly important for global reserves growth, there has also been significant growth in reserves held by other countries with currencies pegged to the US dollar, either directly or as part of a currency basket, such as Hong Kong and Singapore.

For example, the Central Bank of Denmark and the Czech National Bank increased intervention to offset substantial inflows following the European debt crisis and the move to negative yields in the euro area.

"While these processes constitute remarkable feats of international consensusbuilding and have already energised large numbers of people in diverse constituencies – and hopefully will continue to do so in the monitoring of progress through the UN system – it is fair to say that the practical way forward on how to fund and achieve the SDGs is still much less clear than the overarching package of aspirations as such. This lack of clarity is due to at least three fundamental reasons. First, national governments are quite rightly free to select the particular ‘mix’ of making progress towards achieving the SDGs in terms of areas and relative speed that matters most for them, but that balance will take time to establish, will shift over time, and may frequently leave major external partners as well as internal stakeholders lagging behind, or out of step. As we suggested in a preparatory paper for Addis Kharas et al., , the detail of countrylevel SDG financing plans will involve sequencing cho"
"While these trends herald an impending global food crisis, the Southeast Asian region is well positioned to turn it into an opportunity for growth. Given that Southeast Asia is naturally well endowed with agricultural land and rich fishery catchment areas, it is an opportune time for Southeast Asian nations to make full use of the ASEAN Economic Community AEC to fuse the growth of these sectors and to capitalize on the comparative advantage of all ASEAN states to develop Southeast Asia as the global food bowl. ASEAN governments could collectively collaborate and consolidate efforts to advance sustainable fishery production in the region through reviewing their land use policies and agricultural development, coupled with manpower training and research and development in this area. These efforts will help develop local businesses and generate both skilled and nonskilled labour demand in the agricultural and fishery industries. While skilled labour is needed to operate machinery and work "
"Why did MEXT start to build KPIs into their funding projects? The reason is that MEXT believes that these KPIs can increase transparency and fulfill accountability for a large proportion of funds allocated to a small number of universities. However, the problem is that achieving the KPIs has often become a purpose or goal in itself at the selected uni­versities. Eventually, the administrative side tends to end up counting all the apparently rele­vant numbers for each numerical target so that it becomes a kind of “numbers game” of KPIs. Numerical targets should be considered as a means or a guide to achieving the vision and goals of the funding projects as well as of the university’s internationalization efforts. In reality, however, achieving numerical targets becomes the .rst priority. The internationaliza­tion efforts of those universities selected for the funding projects focus on the micromanage­ment of the numerical targets in order to cope with periodic checkups by MEXT and to co"
"Why is this important? This finding supports the contention that most producers of CSAM CSEM are male. However, the significantly lower proportion of female offenders depicted in the analysed series does not negate the importance of understanding the role played by adult and young females in the abuse and exploitation of children. Whether females were seen offending alongside males, or where lone female offenders were seen abusing a child, it was difficult to tell from a visual assessment whether the depicted abuse and exploitation was committed at the behest of the male offender, female offender, or as a truly collaborative act. The role played by females in CSAMCSEM production is apparently complex, particularly in terms of distinguishing females who act as proponents or facilitators of this crime, or both. This area requires further, focused investigation in order to inform improved strategies for the management and prevention of child sexual abuse and exploitation.It is complex to "
"will increase the cost of providing assistance to employees. As a result, companies may look more to alternatives, such as providing a lump sum in lieu of shipment. This lump sum may be used by employees to purchase furnishings in the destination location and store furnishings in the home location. The challenge is that a service focusing on reducing the time spent on moving will now become a timeintensive activity for employees, along with so many other things they have to do. The negative impact on productivity, the extended amount of time it will take to move and the potential for things to go badly when they are not managed professionally are all concerns. Therefore, it is likely we will see new service approaches evolving in that are more consistent with the tax code but also provide important support to employees.Today, DI strategies are more mature in many global companies, so it is time to revisit the Diversity Mobility discussion.

"Will it be any different today? There are a number of reasons to think that the past is not a guide to the future and the weakening is more long lasting. First, the state is much weaker in terms of ensuring physical security in a number of key countries. Syria and Iraq can no longer project power within their borders, let alone outside their borders. Egypt’s domestic challenges prevent it from providing strategic depth for its Gulf allies. Governments’ moral authority has also weakened significantly as economic prospects have dwindled for all but a very small elite at the top. In the s and s, governments were largely able to provide economic security to a middle class that in return showed deference to the rulers. According to the Arab Human Development Reports, this social contract has been coming under increasing pressure since the s. No longer can Arab governments “coopt the educated youth into what used to be a relatively well paid civil service.” For most countries in the region, "
"wing drone use continues to decline to just of rapid aerial data to fuel faster, more accurate users as it finds its own niche in agriculture, oil, and decisions for key business stakeholders. The ease gas applications where longer range, linear flights with which drones can capture data is now met are more common. While there is still demand for with shareability through DroneDeploy’s platform, specialized drone models, most mapping occurs on making it a resource for analysts, advisors, and affordable quadcopter drones. This is largely due management, as well as pilots. to advancements in multirotor drone hardware and extended battery life that was previously only available in more expensive models.rones are quickly finding their place in businesses.

"With funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s State Health Access Reform Evaluation SHARE grant program, a research team led by Dr. Sarah Gollust of the University of Minnesota and Erika Franklin Fowler of Wesleyan University has capitalized on the data available through Google Trends in order to evaluate geographic characteristics associated with Google searches during the ACA’s first open enrollment period. Specifically, the team examined whether geographic regions with higher rates of uninsurance spent more time researching ACA marketplace plans and health insurance coverage generally. They also examined whether other locallevel factors, including sociodemographic, political, and health insurance marketplace characteristics, were associated with higher search volumes. The team hypothesized that searches in general would be higher in areaswith a higher number of uninsured people, but that the relationships may differ depending on the specific keyword searched.­­A key feature"
"With its research partners, the US SIF Foundation developed an information request that was circulated via email to money managers and , institutional investors from April through August. Money managers and institutional investors responding to this information request provided much of the data for this report. Survey recipients were asked to detail whether they considered ESG issues in investment analysis and portfolio selection, to list the issues considered, and to report the value of the USdomiciled assets affected as of December ,. The information request also asked respondents to report their total USdomiciled assets as of yearend and whether they filed shareholder resolutions or engaged in other shareholder engagement activities. Additionally, the research team collected additional data from public and thirdparty sources. The US SIF Foundation was able to identify money managers with. trillion in assets under management of these money managers, were found to incorporate ESG crit"
"With the rise of new technology, how we communicate with businesses and each other has changed. Twenty years ago, it wouldn’t have been out of the question for someone to write a letter praising or disparaging a brand, but today hardly anyone reaches for a pen and paper – they call, email or live chat. With an eye toward the future, it is quite conceivable that the use of even these technologies could be reduced remarkably in favor of something better. But today, Consumers still rely on the telephone most followed closely by email to interact with brands. Why? These channels of communication provide a level of familiarity and convenience that others don’t quite yet, and in many cases, they are the only channels being offered. However, we are seeing online chat beginning to gain popularity, with two in ten surveyed Consumers utilizing this channel for their most recent brand interaction.It’s really about expectations and the unknown. Just under of Consumers said that they find interacti"
"Workers’ remittances to their countries of origin are the prod­uct of income earned by migrant workers and an important source of external financing in many receiving countries. Migrants send remittances to their families supporting an increase in effective demand for consumption as well as for increasing investments in housing, health, education, and small business enterprises in local communities. To the extent that remittances are received largely by poor households, their contribution to poverty reduction is significant, which in turn can help to pave the road towards the achievement of the SDGs. Remittances also provide increased liquidity and foreign exchange to receiving countries facilitat­ing an increase of imports in goods and services. These flows constitute more than per cent of national income for many countries, including a few European countries. Even in the context of larger countries, remittances are an important source of finance. In , the top four recipient countries"

"Worldwide, aluminium foundries benefit from the trend towards lightweight construction. Going forward, a higher share of structural components for light vehicles will be made of cast aluminium. For , we expect a global aluminum foundry production close to million tons. Half of this volume will be casted in Asia, while the Chinese production alone will exceed million tons. German aluminium foundries, with an expected production of. million tons, will gain market shares in Western Europe. Overall, we forecast a volume of. million tons for Europe including Turkey. Growth is also expected in the Americas, where Mexico will significantly gain in importance. For copper casting, we forecast only a slight increase in production volume.The profitability of foundries tended to decrease during the observation period. Main reason for the low profitability was the increasing pricing pressure of the leading customer industry, vehicle manufacturing. Asian foundries experienced the largest decline. Wh"
"Yet we would guess with high confidence that the great majority of spending on big data and AI goes for technology and its development. We hear little about initiatives devoted to changing human attitudes and behaviors around data.
